# New Associated Projects - Accepting Donations

In order for SPI to accept donations for your project online, we need the following information submitted to treasurer@spi-inc.org:

# E-mail address where donation notifications should be sent.
# Donation description

For example, the Debian donation description is "Donation to support the
Debian Project.  The Debian operating system is POSIX based, freely
distributable, and includes features such as true multitasking, virtual
memory, shared libraries, demand loading, proper memory management,
TCP/IP networking, and other features consistent with Unix-type systems.
It is used by individuals and organizations worldwide."

#  Please provide a receipt message (up to 800 characters)

For example, the Debian receipt message is "Thank you for your
contribution in support of the Debian Project!"

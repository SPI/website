# Secretary Duties

## Announcing SPI board meetings

A meeting notice should be sent approximately 10 days before the meeting
to announce the meeting.  A meeting reminder should be sent approximately
two or three days before the meeting.

At the moment, SPI board meetings are conducted on the second Thursday
of the month.  A meeting notice should be posted on Monday or Tuesday
in the week before the board meeting.  The reminder should be posted
on Monday or Tuesday in the week of the board meeting.

The meeting in July is the Annual General Meeting (AGM).  At this meeting,
the annual report is presented.  While the monthly board meetings on IRC
are open to guests and guests are encouraged to participate, the AGM is
an opportunity for SPI members and other interested parties to ask
questions about SPI and its operations.

## Voting during meetings

The SPI Board meets on IRC once per month to conduct board meetings.

During board meetings, votes are cast to approve past minutes and to
vote on resolutions.  An irssi helper script can be used to conduct
the votes.

Load the script:

    /load ~/.irssi/vote.pl

Start a vote:

    /vote_start Meeting minutes for Thursday XX XXXXXXXX 2016:Hydroxide,luca,ganneff,tbm,schultmc,spectranaut,tridge,zobel,xnox

Board members can now vote:

    !vote yes
    !vote no
    !vote abstain

When everyone has voted, stop the vote:

    /vote_stop

The results of the vote will be shown.

## Resolutions

When a new resolution is adopted, it should be posted to `spi-announce`
in addition to the web site.

## Board elections

Board elections are governed by resolution `2004-08-10.dbg.2`.  In
June, the Secretary should post an overview of the upcoming SPI board
election to `spi-announce`.  The timeframe of the actual election
(call for nominations, call for votes, etc) is described in the
resolution.

## Annual report

The by-laws says that SPI will publish an annual report before the SPI
General Meeting.  Technically, the President will produce the report but
in reality it's prepared by the Secretary.  This involves getting updates
from the President, Treasurer and all committees.  Additionally, new
associated projects should be highlighted.  Finally, project liaisons
should be asked to submit brief updates from their projects.

## Conflict of interest

All directors have to submit conflict of interest declarations before
appointment and annually thereafter.  They secretary has to ensure that
annual declarations are filed by all directors and stored.  They are
stored in the `board-private` repository.

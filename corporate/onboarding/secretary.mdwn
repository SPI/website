# Secretary Duties

The role of the Secretary is to:

* Maintain records
* Ensure meetings are conducted and recorded
* Ensure that legal requirements are met

## Record keeping

SPI's records are all in electronic form, with the majority of records
available to the public.  Records include meeting minutes, tax
documents (annual filings and other documents), conflict of interest
declarations and more.

## Legal requirements

SPI is incorporated in the state of New York (NYS).  As such, New
York Not-For-Profit Corporation Law has to be followed.  SPI also has
to operate according to its by-laws.

The Secretary can contact SPI's legal advisors if there are questions
about SPI's operations or legal requirements.

## Announcing SPI board meetings

A meeting notice should be sent approximately 10 days before the meeting
to announce the meeting.  A meeting reminder should be sent approximately
two or three days before the meeting.

At the moment, SPI board meetings are conducted on the second Thursday
of the month.  A meeting notice should be posted on Monday or Tuesday
in the week before the board meeting.  The reminder should be posted
on Monday or Tuesday in the week of the board meeting.

The meeting in July is the Annual General Meeting (AGM).  At this meeting,
the annual report is presented.  While the monthly board meetings on IRC
are open to guests and guests are encouraged to participate, the AGM is
an opportunity for SPI members and other interested parties to ask
questions about SPI and its operations.

## Voting during meetings

The SPI Board meets on IRC once per month to conduct board meetings.

During board meetings, votes are cast to approve past minutes and to
vote on resolutions.  An irssi helper script can be used to conduct
the votes.  The script can be found in the `board` repository.

Load the script:

    /load ~/.irssi/vote.pl

Start a vote:

    /vote_start Meeting minutes for Thursday XX XXXXXXXX 2016:Hydroxide,luca,ganneff,tbm,schultmc,spectranaut,tridge,zobel,xnox

Board members can now vote:

    !vote yes
    !vote no
    !vote abstain

When everyone has voted, stop the vote:

    /vote_stop

The results of the vote will be shown.

## Resolutions

When a new resolution is adopted, it should be posted to `spi-announce`
in addition to the web site.

## Meeting notes

After each board meeting, minutes should be carefully prepared and the
meeting summarized in a neutral manner.  The minutes do not have to
contain every detail from the meeting (especially since the full IRC
log is available) but they should contain the key topics discussed,
decisions taken by the board and actions to be followed up upon.  The
meetings are record of the meeting.

The minutes should be posted to the web site as a draft and the board
informed so they can review them.  Minutes are approved by the board
in the following meeting.

## Board elections

Board elections are governed by [resolution
2004-08-10.dbg.2](../../resolutions/2004/2004-08-10.dbg.2/).  In June,
the Secretary should post an overview of the upcoming SPI board election
to `spi-announce`.  The timeframe of the actual election (call for
nominations, call for votes, etc) is described in the resolution.

## Annual report

The [by-laws](../../by-laws/) say that SPI will publish an annual report
before the SPI General Meeting.  Technically, the President will produce
the report but in reality it's prepared by the Secretary.  This involves
getting updates from the President, Treasurer and all committees.
Additionally, new associated projects should be highlighted.  Finally,
project liaisons should be asked to submit brief updates from their
projects.

## Conflict of interest

All directors have to submit conflict of interest declarations before
appointment and annually thereafter.  The secretary has to ensure that
annual declarations are filed by all directors and stored.  They are
stored in the `board-private` repository.

## Trademarks

SPI holds a number of [trademarks](../../trademarks) on behalf of
associated projects.  Trademarks have to be maintained so they are not
lost.  In the US, renewal is required on a regular basis.

The Secretary should, at least on an annual basis (for example in
preparation for the AGM), review all trademarks held by SPI.  There is a
script in the `board` repository that can be used to check renewal
deadlines for US trademarks.  SPI's legal advisors, Software Freedom Law
Center (SFLC), will also make us aware of filing and renewal deadlines
but we should not rely on them.

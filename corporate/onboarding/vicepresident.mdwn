# Vice President duties

The role of the Vice President is to:

* Perform any duty of the [President](/corporate/onboarding/president) on their
absence or inability to exercise their office, with all the rights, privileges
and powers as if he or she had been the duly elected President;
* Be one of the officers who may sign the checks or drafts of the organization.

## Additional duties

Some duties are delegated by the president to the vice president. While these
delegations can change at any time (the president can reclaim the duty to
perform them), they are largely kept the same to avoid overburdening the president.

Delegated duties are not listed in the president duties on-boarding page.

* Manage SPI Contractors and agents, work with them and approve their reports;
* Act as The Document Foundation [Advisory Board](https://www.documentfoundation.org/advisory-board/) representative.

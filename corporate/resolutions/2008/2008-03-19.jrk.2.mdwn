# Resolution 2008-03-19.jrk.2: Fixing the Debian Open Use Logo License

This resolution was adopted by the Board of Directors of SPI at their 
meeting of [March 19, 2008](/meetings/minutes/2008/2008-03-19/) and was 
repealed by the Board of Directors of SPI at their meeting of [September 
13, 2012](/meetings/minutes/2012/2012-09-13/), with the passage of 
resolution 
[2012-09-07.rtb.1](/corporate/resolutions/2012/2012-09-07.rtb.1/).

### WHEREAS

1. The Board, at its May 18, 2007 meeting, acknowledged the
   Debian Project's relicensing its logos to meet the Debian Free Software
   Guidelines, conditional upon legal approval by SPI's counsel;

2. SPI's legal counsel, as reported at the Board's June 18, 2007
   meeting, suggested some limitations to the relicensing for the purpose
   of retaining enforceable trademark rights in the word "Debian"; and

3. This modified relicensing plan is amenable to the Board and
   to the Debian Project Leader but has not previously been put into
   effect;

### THE BOARD RESOLVES that:

1. Subject to paragraph 2 below, the Debian open use logo depicting a red swirl
   is hereby relicensed under the following terms, where in the phrase "this
   software and associated documentation files", the subphrase "this software"
   shall refer to the logo itself:

>     Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person
>     obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation
>     files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction,
>     including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge,
>     publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software,
>     and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,
>     subject to the following conditions:
>
>     The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be
>     included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.
>
>     THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
>     KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE
>     WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND

>     BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN

>     IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN
>     THE SOFTWARE.

2. This relicensing shall only apply to the version of the Debian open
   use logo which does not include the trademarked word "debian".

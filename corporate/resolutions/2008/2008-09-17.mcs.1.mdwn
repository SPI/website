# Resolution 2008-09-17.mcs.1: Tux4Kids as an Associated Project

This resolution was adopted by the Board of Directors of SPI at their
meeting of [September 17, 2008](/meetings/minutes/2008/2008-09-17/).

### WHEREAS

1. Tux4Kids is a significant Free Software project (an umbrella
   organization around Tux Typing [II] (TuxType); Tux, of Math Command
   (TuxMath) and Tux Paint).

2. The Tux4Kids developers would like SPI's support and assistance,
   including receiving and holding property (e.g., donations) on behalf
   of the project, dispersing donations to project members, legal
   advice and representation, and possibly other services to be decided
   later by Tux4Kids.


### THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

1. Tux4Kids is formally invited to become an SPI Associated Project,
   according to the SPI Framework for Associated Projects, SPI
   Resolution 1998-11-16.iwj.1-amended-2004-08-10.iwj.1, a copy of
   which can be found at

2. Currently, Bill Kendrick and David Bruce are recognised by SPI
   as the current authoritative decisionmakers for Tux4Kids.  In the
   event of a disagreement between them, Bill Kendrick's views take
   precedence.  The decisionmakers will appoint their own successors.

3. This invitation will lapse, if not accepted, 60 days after it is
   approved by the SPI Board.

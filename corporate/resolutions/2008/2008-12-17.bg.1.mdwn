# 2008-12-17.bg.1: Privoxy as associated project

This resolution was adopted by the Board of Directors of SPI at their
meeting of [December 17, 2008](/meetings/minutes/2008/2008-12-17/).

### WHEREAS

1. Privoxy is a significant Free Software project, delivering a non-caching
   HTTP proxy that is commonly used to increase a user's privacy level,
   to block ads, and to rewrite content for other purposes.

2. The Privoxy developers would like SPI's support and assistance,
   including receiving and holding property (e.g., donations) on behalf
   of the project, dispersing donations to project members, legal
   advice and representation, holding assets such as the privoxy.org domain,
   and possibly other services to be decided later by the Privoxy developers.


### THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

1. Privoxy is formally invited to become an SPI Associated Project,
   according to the SPI Framework for Associated Projects, SPI

2. Fabian Keil is recognised by SPI as the current authoritative decision
   maker for Privoxy.  This can be changed in the future by consensus vote
   of Hal Burgiss, Fabian Keil, and David Schmidt.

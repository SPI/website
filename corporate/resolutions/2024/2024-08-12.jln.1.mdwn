# Resolution 2024-08-12.jln.1: Legal Counsel Fees

CONSIDERING that SPI no longer has a free as in gratis legal counsel; and

CONSIDERING that having a paid attorney option provides strategic advantages to
SPI and its associated projects, and that SPI purpose is to support its projects
collectively, as stated in the Certificate of Incorporation,

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

In this resolution, "attorney", "lawyer" and "legal counsel" terms are used
interchangeably.

1. Legal fees incurred by projects which require the use of a paid attorney will
be billed against the project;

2. If a pro bono attorney offers SPI their services, or withdraw their offer for
free services, SPI will inform that at least in the projects mailing list, so the
projects may opt for the option more aligned with their goals;

3. Legal services which can benefit multiple projects, such as templates, will be
invoiced against SPI General Fund as is current practice;

4. If SPI decides that consulting a paid attorney is required as part of the
process for providing some other service, the project will only be billed with
the liaison's approval;

5. When a project has requested SPI legal counsel, has no assets to cover for it,
and SPI has no pro bono lawyers available, SPI will decide administratively to
either temporarily refuse the request until a pro bono attorney becomes available,
or to sponsor the request with the General Fund.

6. Legal Fees incurred of SPI's interest as a whole, or which cannot be
appropriately divided by project, will be billed against SPI general fund.

7. When financial reality allows for it, SPI Treasury or Board may resolve to
cover certain low volume, day to day or regular expenses such as trademark
renewals with the General Fund.

8. Revoke resolutions 2007-11-14.jdd.1.jb.1 and 2004-09-07.dbg.2

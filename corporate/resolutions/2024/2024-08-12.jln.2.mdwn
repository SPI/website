# Resolution 2024-08-12.jln.2: The Mana World rebrand as Manasource

WHEREAS

1. SPI currently recognizes The Mana World as a SPI associated project (as per
[2014-07-07.mzh.1](/corporate/resolutions/2014/2014-07-07.mzh.1)).

2. The Mana World decided to rename its organization to "Manasource", with no
changes to their intents and values, to reduce confusion with their different game
projects. A new homepage reflecting these changes is available at https://manasource.org

3. The administrative team and executive body of the organisation remains
unchanged in its sturcture and is now known as Mana Team (formerly TMW Team or
TMW Committee).

4. "The Mana World" brand will continue being used for their oldest game and
retain its website at https://themanaworld.org

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

1. SPI recognises the name change of the Manasource project from The Mana World
and will update its records accordingly.

2. SPI recognises the name change of Mana Team from TMW Team/TMW Committee and
will endavour to keep references to it consistent on its website and in regards
to the 2014 resolution.

3. William Pine continues to be recognised as the current authoritative decision
maker and SPI liaison for Manasource. Future liaisons will be appointed in turn by
the sitting project liaison, or by a simple majority of existing Mana Team
members, as defined in https://forums.themanaworld.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=17166

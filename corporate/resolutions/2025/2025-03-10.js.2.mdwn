# SPI resolution 2025-03-10.js.2: Removal of Aptosid as an associated project

WHEREAS

1. Aptosid is currently an SPI associated project.

2. The Aptosid project, a GNU/Linux distribution based on Debian
   unstable, has been defunct for many years and is no longer under
   active development.

3. The Aptosid project liaison was unable to be reached for comment.

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

1. Aptosid is removed from the list of SPI associated projects.

2. SPI will no longer actively seek donations on behalf of Aptosid.

3. SPI will endeavor in good faith to identify and contact the
   latest donors to the Aptosid project whose donations were not
   used, to inquire if they wish to repurpose earmarked donations or
   have them returned. Donors claiming refunds may be required to
   fill Form 1040X and submit the amendment to the IRS.

4. If the earmarking of the remaining assets was done in error, the
   earmark will be rectified and the money will be deposited in SPI
   General Fund.

5. This is subject to any undischarged obligations SPI may have with
   respect to Aptosid. We are not aware of any such undischarged
   obligations. We ask anyone who is aware of any to notify us
   within 30 days of this resolution.

# SPI resolution 2025-03-10.js.1: Removal of Fluxbox as an associated project

WHEREAS

1. Fluxbox is currently an SPI associated project.

2. The Fluxbox project, an open source window manager for X, has
   been defunct for many years and is no longer under active
   development.

3. The Fluxbox project liaison confirmed this to be the case.

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

1. Fluxbox is removed from the list of SPI associated projects.

2. SPI will no longer actively seek donations on behalf of Fluxbox.

3. SPI will endeavor in good faith to identify and contact the
   latest donors to the Fluxbox project whose donations were not
   used, to inquire if they wish to repurpose earmarked donations or
   have them returned. Donors claiming refunds may be required to
   fill Form 1040X and submit the amendment to the IRS.

4. If the earmarking of the remaining assets was done in error, the
   earmark will be rectified and the money will be deposited in SPI
   General Fund.

5. This is subject to any undischarged obligations SPI may have with
   respect to Fluxbox. We are not aware of any such undischarged
   obligations. We ask anyone who is aware of any to notify us
   within 30 days of this resolution.

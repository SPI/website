# Resolution 2005-12-13.jrk.1: OpenVAS as an Associated Project

This resolution was adopted by the Board of Directors of SPI at their
meeting of [December 13, 2005](/meetings/minutes/2005/2005-12-13/).

This resolution is superseded by [2007-06-18.iwj.2](../../2007/2007-06-18.iwj.2).

WHEREAS

1. OpenVAS is a significant Free Software project.  (OpenVAS is the
   Open Source fork of Nessus.)

2. The OpenVAS developers would like SPI's support and assistance,
   including DNS hosting and registration and possibly other services
   including taking donations, to be decided later by OpenVAS.

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

3. OpenVAS is formally invited to become an SPI Associated Project,
   according to the SPI Framework for Associated Projects, SPI
   Resolution 1998-11-16.iwj.1-amended-2004-08-10.iwj.1, a copy of
   which can be found at

4. Currently, Tim Brown, Sean Baumann and Robert Berkowitz are
   recognised by SPI as the authoritative decisionmakers for OpenVAS;
   any two out of the three must agree any particular decision
   (including any decision to delegate).  Tim, Sean and Robert have

   consultation on relevant OpenVAS mailing list(s).

   approved by the SPI Board.

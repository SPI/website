# Resolution 2009-09-08.jrk.2: OSUNIX as associated project

This resolution was adopted by the Board of Directors of SPI at their
meeting of [September 16, 2009](/meetings/minutes/2009/2009-09-16/).

### WHEREAS

1. OSUNIX is a substantial and useful open source project,

2. OSUNIX would like SPI's support and assistance, including taking
   donations, and

3. OSUNIX engaged the Software Freedom Law Center separately from their
   representation of SPI and obtained from them an opinion letter which
   satisfactorily addresses SPI's legal concerns with regard to OSUNIX,


### THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

1. OSUNIX is formally invited to become an SPI
   Associated Project, according to the SPI Framework for Associated
   Projects, SPI Resolution 1998-11-16.iwj.1-amended-2004-08-10.iwj.1, a
   copy of which can be found at
   [https://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/resolutions/2004/2004-08-10.iwj.1](/corporate/resolutions/2004/2004-08-10.iwj.1/)

2. Currently, Christopher Bergstrom is recognised by SPI as the current
   authoritative decision maker and SPI liaison for OSUNIX. The SPI Board
   expresses its desire for Christopher Bergstrom to clarify the governance
   structure of OSUNIX to the Board, which structure the Board will
   recognize as it would any other instruction from an associated project.

3. This invitation will lapse, if not accepted, 60 days after it is
   approved by the SPI Board.

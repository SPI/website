# Resolution 2002-07-02.iwj.5: Supporting The Open and Free Technology Community

July 2nd, 2002

This resolution was adopted by the Board of Directors of SPI at their
meeting of [July 2, 2002](/meetings/minutes/2002/2002-07-02).

[The Open and Free Technology Community](http://www.oftc.net/)
(henceforth referred to as "OFTC") was founded at the end of 2001 by a group
of experienced members of the Open Source and Free Software communities, and
aims to provide these communities with better communication, development,
and support infrastructure.

The Board resolves to accept OFTC as an SPI supported project; the board
will accept donations earmarked for OFTC, if OFTC requests this, and again
will spend money according to the OFTC constitution (again provided this is
in accordance with SPI's legal obligations).

As part of supporting OFTC, the Board of Directors of SPI resolves that
it will accept ownership of the domain name, "OFTC.net", in trust, and will
administer it as directed according to the constitution of the OFTC (subject
to SPI's legal obligations).

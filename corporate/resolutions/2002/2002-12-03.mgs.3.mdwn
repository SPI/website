# 2002-12-03.mgs.3: Resolution editing
    
December 3rd, 2002

The resolution below has been accepted and approved via email voting
by the Board of Directors of Software in the Public Interest,
Inc. ("SPI") on December 10th, 2002.

When resolutions are proposed by a Board member they are numbered as
described in the procedure about resolutions (resolution
<a title="1998-09-24.iwj.5" href="1998-09-24.iwj.html" target="_self">1998-09-24.iwj.5</a>) which says:

> The resolution number should be in the form YYYY-MM-DD.PROP.UNIQ
> where PROP is an indication of the proposer (such as their
> initials), who allocates the number, and UNIQ is a number added
> for uniqueness. The same resolution number may not be given to two
> different resolutions or texts.

When the resolution is edited, corrected, rephrased or expanded by
another member of the Board of Directors, the subsequent editor shall
not issue an entirely new resolution nor remove the initials of the
original proposer but issue an update and name it by adding his
initials to the resolution number.

# Resolution 2002-11-07.ers.mgs: Complete the FSG membership agreement

November 7th, 2002

The resolution below has been accepted and approved via email voting
by the Board of Directors of Software in the Public Interest,
Inc. ("SPI") on December 3rd, 2002.

SPI has been presented with an agreement which will allow Debian to
participate in the FSG process. Participation in the FSG is important
for Debian.

The Board of Directors of SPI agree that SPI will join the Free
Standards Group (FSG) with the exception below. The FSG membership
agreement will be completed, signed and returned to the FSG by a
member of the SPI Board with the full authorization of the SPI Board.

The participation of so many of the Debian members in the FSG
standards is a full waiver for any other fees, according to the FSG.

Clause 2.6 of the membership agreement does not have any effect to
SPI, its member organisations and their members.

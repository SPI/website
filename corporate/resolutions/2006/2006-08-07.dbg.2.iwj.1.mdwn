# 2006-08-07.dbg.2.iwj.1: Attendance Policy

This resolution was adopted by the Board of Directors of SPI at their
meeting of [September 19, 2006](/meetings/minutes/2006/2006-09-19/).
This resolution supersedes [2001-09-17.br](/corporate/resolutions/2001/2001-09-17.br/)

* __WHEREAS__ the Board of Directors of Software in the Public Interest is
  responsible for the operation of the organisation;
* and __WHEREAS__ the Board of Directors performs its business at its meetings;
* and __WHEREAS__ Board members are expected to attend all meetings;
* and __WHEREAS__ Board members who do not attend a reasonable number of
  meetings can prevent the Board from carrying out its duties;

__The Board of Directors hereby resolves that:__

* The Accounting Period for this Attendance Policy shall be one year, ending
  with the most recent Board meeting, including any meeting in session;
* All Board members shall be recorded in the meeting minutes of all board
  meetings while they are members as having an attendance status that is
  one of:
  1. Absent,
  2. Absent, with regrets,
  3. Present, with exception,
  4. Present;
* A Board member who fails to attend a valid Board meeting, and who has not
  sent the Board regrets for the meeting at least twenty-four (24) hours
  prior to the scheduled start of the meeting, shall be marked as:
  "Absent", but may, by a vote of the Board at the time the Minutes are
  being approved for that meeting be marked as "Absent, with regrets"
  without notice having been received should the Board be satisfied that
  reasonable notice was not possible;
* A Board member who fails to attend a valid Board meeting, but who has sent
  the Board regrets at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the scheduled
  start of the meeting, shall be marked as: "Absent, with regrets";
* A Board member who attends a valid Board meeting shall be marked as
  "Present", but shall be marked as "Present, with exception" if he does not:
  1. Register as present during Roll Call, and
  2. Participate or actively abstain in all votes, and
  3. Respond to all Quorum Calls called for by the meeting Chair;
* A Quorum Call may be called by the meeting Chair at any time during
  meeting if he reasonably believes that the number of members still
  attending are insufficient to retain Quorum, and all members present
  must respond in acknowledgement of their presence. Such Quorum calls
  and their results shall be recorded in the meeting Minutes;
* All Board members shall be considered "Present" for all meetings for the year
  prior to their first appointment to the Board;
* If a board member is:
  1. marked as "Absent" for the greater of 20% or three Board meetings during
     the accounting period, or
  2. marked as "Absent, with regrets" for the greater of 40% or five Board
     meetings during the accounting period, or
  3. not marked as "Present" for the lesser of 50% or seven Board meetings
     during the accounting period;
  the Secretary will put onto the agenda for the next Board meeting a motion
  to ask the board member to resign.
* This resolution and all its effects shall take place effective with the
  passage of this resolution, with no action being taken for attendance
  records prior to its implementation.

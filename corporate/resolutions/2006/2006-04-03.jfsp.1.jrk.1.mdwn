# 2006-04-03.jfsp.1.jrk.1: Debian trademark in Spain
    
### Whereas:

1. The Debian trademark is held on behalf of Debian by SPI.

2. As confirmed by Steve McIntyre, who is Debian's 2nd-In-Command (2IC) and
temporary delegated Debian Project Leader (DPL), the DPL requests, on behalf
of Debian, that SPI defend the Debian trademark.

### It Is Resolved, that:

1. A liaison shall be appointed to serve between the SPI board and Javier
Fernández-Sanguino Peña and/or Javier de la Cueva for the purpose of protecting
and administering the Debian trademark in Spain.

2. The liaison shall be authorized, on behalf of SPI, to take any appropriate
action up to and including initiation of lawsuits in the name of SPI if, in the
liaison's view, it is appropriate to do so to protect the Debian trademark in
Spain. The liaison and each officer of SPI, acting individually, are hereby
authorized to execute, on behalf of SPI, any documents falling within the
liaison's mandate.

3. The liaison will report to the board and SPI's membership at each meeting of
the board.

4. The liaison will endeavour to seek the opinion of as much of the board as
time will permit regarding all substantive actions before taking them.

### It Is Further Resolved that:

1. Neil McGovern shall serve as this liaison until he resigns, the board
appoints a different liaison, the board removes him without immediately filling
the vacancy, or the board decides a liaison is no longer required.

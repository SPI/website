# Resolution 2004-10-04.jrk.1: Begin Banking with FirstIB

October 4th, 2004

This resolution was adopted by the Board of Directors of SPI at their
meeting of [October 5, 2004](/meetings/minutes/2004/2004-10-05), on
the understanding that the Treasurer will seek to keep the balance of
this account below US$5000 in order to mitigate any loss liability risk.

WHEREAS SPI has found its current banking relationship with American
Express Centurion Bank to be unsatisfactory;

WHEREAS the Treasurer of SPI has investigated multiple alternative
banking options and concluded that SPI should move its checking accounts
to the First Internet Bank of Indiana (henceforth "FirstIB");

WHEREAS the Treasurer has authority under SPI bylaws to proceed without
further approval, but is required under FirstIB's application procedures
to obtain a formal resolution of the Board:

### SPI's Board of Directors HEREBY RESOLVES THAT

   directed to work together as necessary to complete and submit to FirstIB

   that are listed in the "RESOLUTIONS" section of the FirstIB Corporate
   Resolution form as of October 4, 2004, which are required to open a

   reference, and which will be appended to the published text of this
   resolution once it has been approved by the Board;
3. The initial authorized signers for the account shall be the
   Treasurer, Deputy Treasurer, and President;
4. The Corporate Resolution form shall be filled out such that power #1
   (all listed powers) is granted to the Treasurer, requiring one

   one signature; and
5. The Treasurer may authorize without further Board approval the
   purchase and provision to FirstIB of such government certificates as may
   be required by FirstIB to complete the application process, including
   but not limited to a certified copy of our articles of incorporation
   and/or a certificate of good standing, although no such requirement is
   anticipated as of the passing of this resolution.

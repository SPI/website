March 2nd, 2004

This resolution was adopted by the Board of Directors of SPI at their
meeting of [March 2, 2004](/meetings/minutes/2004/2004-03-02).

### Whereas

1. Software in the Public Interest has received via Bruce Perens a
   request from wxWidgets (formerly wxWindows), regarding wxWidgets
   becoming an SPI-associated project.

2. wxWidgets is a respectable and useful Free Software project.
   SPI would be pleased for wxWidgets to become an SPI Associated
   Project (according to the Framework for Associated Projects).

### The Board of SPI resolves that

1. We invite the wxWidgets Core Team to confirm that they
   would like to become an Associated Project.

2. Subject to the approval of the wxWidgets Core Team, and in
   particular their confirmation that the Core Team is happy with the
   Framework for Associated Projects, SPI will start to take donations
   to be held in trust for purposes related to wxWidgets.

3. We invite the wxWidgets Core Team to clarify the decisionmaking
   structure of the wxWidgets Project. In particular, we would like
   to know how decisions about disbursement of funds for purposes
   related to wxWidgets will be approved by the wxWidgets Project, and
   how those decisions will be communicated to the SPI Treasurer.

# Resolution 2004-10-05.bmh.1: Permanent Legal Address

October 5th, 2004

This resolution was adopted by the Board of Directors of SPI at their
meeting of [October 5, 2004](/meetings/minutes/2004/2004-10-05).

### Whereas

1. New York State requires corporations to appoint a registered agent in
   the state where the company is formed. The registered agent is
   responsible for receiving important legal and tax documents
   including: notice of litigation (service of process), franchise tax
   forms and annual report forms.

2. SPI's information on file with the State of New York is currently out
   of date and must be updated immediately. Rather than use the address
   of a board member living in New York State, the board would be well
   served to look for a permanent solution not dependent on any single
   member.

### It is resolved that

1. The Board authorizes Benjamin Mako Hill to hire Corporation Services
   Company, Business Filings or another suitable corporation, at
   Hill's discretion, to provide a registered office in the State of New
   York for the next calendar year.

2. Additionally, the Board authorizes an amendment or restatement of
   SPI's certificate of incorporation recognizing:

   1. The change in the location of the Company's registered office to
      the address designated by the provider of registered office services;
   2. The appointment of CSC or Business Filings as a registered agent of
      SPI;
   3. The change in the post office address to which the Secretary of
      State of the State of New York shall mail process served on the Secretary
      of State to an address designated by the provider of registered agent
      services.

3. Hill is further authorized to incur expenses related to the
   acquisition of these services of up to USD 200 for the next year
   which will be reimbursed by SPI.

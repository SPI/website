# Resolution 2010-10-11.jmd.1: Recognition of sidux name change

This resolution was adopted by the Board of Directors of SPI at their
meeting of [October 13, 2010](/meetings/minutes/2010/2010-10-13/).

### WHEREAS

1. sidux is an existing associated SPI project (as per
   [2009-11-27.jmd.2](../../2009/2009-11-27.jmd.2))

2. sidux has parted ways with sidux e.V. and as a result renamed the
   project to aptosid to avoid issues over the sidux name.

3. The aptosid development team remains unchanged from sidux and the
   sidux website indicates that the renaming has taken place.

### THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

1. SPI recognises the name change of the sidux project from aptosid
   and will update its records accordingly.

2. Ferdinand Thommes continues to be recognised as the current
   authoritative decision maker and SPI liaison for aptosid. In the event
   of the liaison becoming unavailable Trevor Walkley will act as temporary
   liaison and notify SPI of any replacement liaison.

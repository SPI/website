# Resolution 2018-07-13.mm.1: Removal of OSUNIX as an associated project

This resolution was adopted by the Board of Directors of SPI at their
meeting of [August 13, 2018](/meetings/minutes/2018/2018-08-13/).

WHEREAS

1. OSUNIX became an Associated Project of SPI in 2009.

2. The goal of OSUNIX was to be the first entirely open source
OpenSolaris technology distribution.

3. OSUNIX is no longer active.

4. Donations to OSUNIX were made to improve open source OpenSolaris
technologies.

5. OSUNIX project liaison Christopher Bergström has decided to transfer
funds held by SPI to the OpenZFS project, another SPI Associated
Project based on technology from OpenSolaris.

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

1. OSUNIX will be removed as an SPI Associated Project.

2. SPI will no longer actively seek donations on behalf of OSUNIX.

3. All assets, including (without limitation) money and any future
donations, held by SPI on behalf of OSUNIX, will henceforth be held

We are not aware of any such undischarged obligations.  We ask anyone
who is aware of any to notify us within 30 days of this resolution.

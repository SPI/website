# Resolution 2007-02-28.iwj.1.jrk.1: Formally recording Debian's status as an Associated Project

This resolution was adopted by the Board of Directors of SPI at their
meeting of [March 16, 2007](/meetings/minutes/2007/2007-03-16/).

### Whereas

1. Debian is a substantial and significant Free Software project;

2. SPI and Debian regard Debian as an SPI Associated Project; however

3. The detailed terms of the Association have not been formally stated by the
SPI Board in the manner now customary.

### The SPI Board Declares That;

1. Debian is already an SPI Associated Project, according to the SPI
Framework for Associated Projects, SPI Resolution
1998-11-16.iwj.1-amended-2004-08-10.iwj.1, a copy of which can be
found at
[https://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/resolutions/2004/2004-08-10.iwj.1](/corporate/resolutions/2004/2004-08-10.iwj.1)

2. The Debian Constitution
(http://www.debian.org/devel/constitution), and the persons holding
the roles it defines and acting according to that Constitution, are
recognised by SPI as ultimately authoritative regarding decisions of
the Debian Project.

3. The SPI Board does not intend to monitor the Debian mailing lists.
The Board will recognise decisions, statements, and delegations made by
the Debian Project Leader, currently Anthony Towns, as made on behalf of
Debian, except to the extent this assumption is contradicted by
information to the SPI Board by the Debian Project Secretary in
accordance with paragraph 4.

4. The Board specifically asks that the Debian Project Secretary inform
the SPI Board of any Debian General Resolutions which might be relevant
to SPI, including any proposals to put spending on hold, as well as any
dispute or change regarding the identity or authority of the Debian
Project Leader.

5. The Board relies on Debian Developers and others to ensure that the
Board is made aware of Debian decisions relevant to SPI that are not
communicated to the Board in a timely manner by the Debian Project
Leader or the Debian Project Secretary; of disagreement among Debian
developers regarding the identity of the Debian Project Leader or the
Debian Project Secretary; and of disagreement among Debian developers as
to the authority held by either of those two Debian officials, but only
insofar as this authority is relevant to SPI. The Board requests that
those who notify it of decisions or disagreements in accordance with
this paragraph take reasonable efforts to look for prior notifications
to the Board on the same topic, and that the Board not be notified again
if the new notification would be substantially the same as a previous
one.

6. The Debian Constitution in 5.1(10) gives the Project Leader the
primary responsibility to decide on the proper uses of assets held in
trust by SPI for Debian purposes.

> Notwithstanding this, for the avoidance of any doubt, the SPI
> Board and Treasurer cannot and will not delegate their judgement
> as to whether a proposed use of assets meets SPI's charitable
> purposes. As recognised by the Debian Constitution in 9.2(1), SPI
> must make that decision, itself ensuring SPI's funds are used
> lawfully.

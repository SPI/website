### WHEREAS

1. OpenVAS is a significant Free Software project.  (OpenVAS is the
   Open Source fork of Nessus.)

2. The OpenVAS developers would like SPI's support and assistance,
   including DNS hosting and registration and possibly other services
   including taking donations, to be decided later by OpenVAS.

3. OpenVAS have resolved the problems that previously caused them to
   be uncontactable and which led SPI to drop OpenVAS as an associated
   Project.

   Project, according to the SPI Framework for Associated Projects,

# Resolution 2007-11-14.jdd.1.jb.1: Obtaining new legal counsel

This resolution was adopted by the Board of Directors of SPI at their
meeting of [November 14, 2007](/meetings/minutes/2007/2007-11-14/).

This resolution is superseded by [2024-08-12.jln.1](../../2024/2024-08-12.jln.1).

### Whereas

1. Gregory Pomerantz is the current pro-bono SPI attorney.

2. SPI has grown to a point where we need more legal advice than Mr.
Pomerantz's pro-bono time allows.

### The SPI board resolves that

1. Software Freedom Law Center shall be retained to provide legal services to
SPI in addition to those provided by Mr. Pomerantz.

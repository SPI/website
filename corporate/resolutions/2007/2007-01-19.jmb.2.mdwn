# 2007-01-19.jmb.2: Moving SPI bank account

### Whereas:

1. As an organization with international scope, SPI needs the services of at
least a national if not an international bank

2. Our current bank has only one physical location, which is not convenient to
any board member

### The Board hereby

1. authorizes the Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer to open a checking account
for Software In The Public Interest, Inc. at a bank to be selected by consensus
of the Treasurer, Assistant Treasurer and Secretary after discussion on the
"spi-private" mailing list.

2. Up to $30,000 will be initally transferred to the account.

3. The signatories on the account will include the following, according to to
the signatory rights previously discussed on board@ and ratified at the
2006-09-19 meeting:

<table class="plain">
<tbody>
<tr><td>Josh Berkus<br /></td><td>Treasurer </td></tr>
<tr><td>Michael Schultheiss </td><td>Assistant Treasurer </td></tr>
<tr><td>Neil McGovern </td><td>Secretary </td></tr>
<tr><td>Bdale Garbee </td><td>President<br /></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Given the President's travel schedule, his signature may be added to the
account after initial account opening.

# 2007-01-19.jmb.2: Moving SPI bank account

This resolution was adopted by the Board of Directors of SPI at their
meeting of [January 16, 2007](/meetings/minutes/2007/2007-01-16/).

### Whereas:

1. As an organization with international scope, SPI needs the services of at
least a national if not an international bank

2. Our current bank has only one physical location, which is not convenient to
any board member

### The Board hereby

1. authorizes the Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer to open a checking account
for Software In The Public Interest, Inc. at a bank to be selected by consensus
of the Treasurer, Assistant Treasurer and Secretary after discussion on the
"spi-private" mailing list.

2. Up to $30,000 will be initially transferred to the account.

3. The signatories on the account will include the following, according to to
the signatory rights previously discussed on board@ and ratified at the
2006-09-19 meeting:

* Josh Berkus: Treasurer
* Michael Schultheiss: Assistant Treasurer
* Neil McGovern: Secretary
* Bdale Garbee: President

Given the President's travel schedule, his signature may be added to the
account after initial account opening.

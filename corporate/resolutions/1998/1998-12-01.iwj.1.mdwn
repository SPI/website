December 1st, 1998

1. Whereas some former member(s) of the Board of Software in the
Public Interest, Inc. ('SPI') have expressed intention to assign to
third parties or other organisations trademarks, owned by the
corporation, without due authorisation, process or consultation; and

2. Whereas, although those former board member(s) are aware of the

formal footing; and

3. Whereas some former board member(s) are believed to be in the
possession of papers relating to trademarks owned by the corporation;

until a determination of the intended future of the Open Source

order, and to ensure that it is aware of the status of the
corporation's trademarks;

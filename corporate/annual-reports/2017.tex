\section{New Associated Projects}

SPI added no new associated projects during 2017.

\section{Projects No Longer Associated with SPI}

\subsection{FreedomBox}

FreedomBox Foundation, the organizational headquarters of FreedomBox,
was recognized by the IRS as exempt from federal income tax under
Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3).  Therefore, future donations will
be handled directly by the FreedomBox Foundation.

\section{Updates from Associated Projects}

\subsection{Debian}

The next stable release of the distribution (`buster') has been taking
shape since the release of Debian 9 (`stretch') in June 2017.

In addition, the Debian project continues its efforts to run the LTS
program for extended security support and a large migration is underway
to new Git hosting infrastructure based on the GitLab platform. In
Addison, Debian's annual gathering (DebConf) was held in Montréal,
Québec.

On 16th August 2017, the Debian project celebrated its 24th anniversary.
This is a new milestone for the project and makes it one of the oldest
Free and Open Source GNU/Linux distributions.

\subsection{Drizzle}

The Drizzle database server is no longer actively developed. However,
two of the client libraries are still in active use and development:
drizzle-jdbc (Java) and libdrizzle-redux (C). One motivation for
continued use of these libraries is that they provide permissively
licensed client libraries compatible with the MySQL protocol.

\subsection{Open MPI}

The Open MPI community is a collection of academics, researchers, and
vendors who continue to develop cutting-edge technology for today's
most-demanding High Performance Computing (HPC) environments.  This
community had a busy year in 2017: we had nine releases of our signature
project (Open MPI).  We closed out the v1.10.x series with 1.10.6 and
1.10.7 releases.  We also closed out the v2.0.x series with versions
2.0.2 through 2.0.4.  We introduced a new minor release series (v2.1.x)
and releases v2.1.0 through v2.1.2.  Finally, we introduce a new major
release series with v3.0.0.  The Hardware Locality (hwloc) sub-project
also had several releases, including contributions from both the overall
community several vendors: v1.11.6 through v1.11.8.  Hwloc also released
a beta for its upcoming all-new v2.0.0 series, which is anticipated in
2018.

\chapter{About SPI}

SPI is a non-profit organization which was founded to help organizations
develop and distribute open hardware and software. We encourage programmers
to use the GNU General Public License or other licenses that allow free
redistribution and use of software, and hardware developers to distribute
documentation that will allow device drivers to be written for their product.

SPI was incorporated as a non-profit organization on June 16, 1997 in the state
of New York. Since then, it has become an umbrella organization for projects
from the community.

In 1999, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the United States government
determined that under section 501 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code SPI
qualifies for 501 (c) (3) (non-profit organization) status under section 509
(a) (1) and 170 (b) (1) (A) (vi). This means that donations made to SPI and its
supported projects should be tax deductible for the American donor.

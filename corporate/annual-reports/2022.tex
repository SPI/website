\chapter{About SPI}

SPI is a non-profit organization which was founded to help organizations develop and distribute open hardware and software. We encourage programmers to use the GNU General Public License or other licenses that allow free redistribution and use of software, and hardware developers to distribute documentation that will allow device drivers to be written for their product.

SPI was incorporated as a non-profit organization on June 16, 1997 in the state of New York. Since then, it has become an umbrella organization for projects from the community.

In 1999, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the United States government determined that under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code SPI qualifies for 501(c)(3) (non-profit organization) status under section 509(a)(1) and 170(b)(1)(A)(vi). This means that donations made to SPI and its supported projects are tax-deductible as charitable donations for US taxpayers.

\chapter{Member Project Reports}

\section{New Associated Projects}

We have continued to see a reasonable level of interest from projects
who wish to become associated with SPI. Over the past year, 8 projects
joined the SPI umbrella as an Associated Project.

\subsection{ArduPilot}

ArduPilot is a cross-platform free software autopilot project for all
types of small robotic vehicles. With a very active developer and user
community ArduPilot provides sophisticated navigation and control for
all types of flying vehicles, boats and ground vehicles.

\subsection{Glucosio}

Glucosio is an open source project dedicated to bringing open source
apps to smartphone, desktop and web in order to help people with
diabetes improve their health outcomes by better self-management of
their disease. At the same time, Glucosio offers the opportunity for
opt-in to crowdsourcing of anonymized health trends and demographics to
support diabetes research. Apps are dual licensed under the GPLv3/MPL
2.0 license.

\subsection{NTPsec}

The NTPsec project is a more secure, hardened, and improved
implementation of Network Time Protocol derived from NTP Classic, Dave
Mills's original. We employ best practices and state-of-the art
technology in code auditing, verification, and testing to deliver code
that can be used with confidence in deployments with the most stringent
security, availability, and assurance requirements.

\subsection{OpenZFS}

OpenZFS is an umbrella project which brings together individuals and
companies that use and improve the ZFS file system, and encourages the
widespread use of ZFS and its development in a true open-source manner.

ZFS is storage software which combines the functionality of traditional
filesystems, volume manager, and more. ZFS include protection against
data corruption, support for high storage capacities, efficient data
compression, snapshots and copy-on-write clones, continuous integrity
checking and automatic repair, remote replication with ZFS send and
receive, and RAID-Z.

\subsection{Torch}

Torch is a scientific computing framework with wide support for machine
learning algorithms that puts GPUs first. It is easy to use and
efficient, thanks to an simple and fast scripting language, Lua, and an
underlying C/CUDA implementation.

\subsection{X.Org}

The X.Org community creates a free and open accelerated graphics stack,
including major components such as the DRM kernel graphics subsystem,
Mesa 3D graphics library, Wayland compositor and the X.Org Window
System.

\subsection{Performance Co-Pilot}

Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) provides a framework and services to support
system-level performance monitoring and management. It presents a
unifying abstraction for all of the performance data in a system, and
many tools for interrogating, retrieving and processing that data.

PCP is a feature-rich, mature, extensible, cross-platform toolkit
supporting both live and retrospective analysis. The distributed PCP
architecture makes it especially useful for those seeking centralized
monitoring of distributed processing.

\subsection{Open MPI}

The Open MPI Project is an open source Message Passing Interface
implementation that is developed and maintained by a consortium of
academic, research, and industry partners. Open MPI is therefore able to
combine the expertise, technologies, and resources from all across the
High Performance Computing community in order to build the best MPI
library available. Open MPI's plugin-based architecture offers
advantages for system and software vendors, application developers and
computer science researchers.


\section{Updates from Associated Projects}

\subsection{Drizzle}

The Drizzle database server is no longer actively developed. However,
two of the client libraries were actively developed and used in 2016:
drizzle-jdbc (Java) and libdrizzle-redux (C). One motivation for
continued use of these libraries is that they provide permissively
licensed client libraries compatible with the MySQL protocol.

\subsection{Jenkins}

Jenkins project has released its first major new version, Jenkins 2, in
March, participated in Google Summer of Code for the first time, and
entered into an agreement with Microsoft to migrate our infrastructure
to Azure under the Microsoft sponsorship. In terms of development, two
key efforts are under way; declarative pipeline, which improves the
Jenkins pipeline functionality by making it easier and more
approachable, is one.  Blue ocean, which redefines the user experience
of Jenkins, is another.

\subsection{NTPsec}

The NTPsec Project continues with our refactoring and cleanup of the NTP
code base.  We made 6 point releases in 2016 and continue our drive to 1.0.0.

All the command line tooling has been migrated away from C, Perl, Perl4,
and S+ into modern Python.  All reported CVEs against NTP Classic were
already fixed before discovery, or we addressed and fixed them within a
few days.  The core protocol statement has been refactored, with many
bugs removed and with unsafe and not-security-possible modes removed.
We are maintaining a strict mode warnings-free compilation hygiene, and
a strict Coverity warnings hygiene.

\subsection{SproutCore}

SproutCore is an open source framework for building fast, innovative
user experiences on the web. In the last year we made two release with
bug fixes (1.11.1 and 1.11.2). We are currently preparing a major 2.0
release which will only work with the new NodeJS base build tools. We
will continue to provide bug fixes for the stable 1.11.x release which
still works with the old build tools. We also are replacing the default
image based theme with a pure CSS3 theme.  See
\href{https://github.com/sproutcore/sproutcore/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md}{the
changelog} for more information.

\subsection{Tux4Kids}

Tux4Kids develops high-quality software for kids.  Tux4Kids effort Tux
Paint has not had a new release in 2016 but a number of features have
been added, including a color selector tool, one new localization
(Kabyle) and a variety of bug fixes and new sound effects.  We're
desperately seeking a Mac OS X (aka macOS) developer to come on board
the project since the latest Apple OS release has caused Tux Paint to
break.  As schools, especially, upgrade to Sierra, they find themselves
unable to run Tux Paint any more, which is very sad.

\subsection{YafaRay}

YafaRay is a free open-source montecarlo raytracing engine released
under the LGPL 2.1 license.  In general 2016 has been a good year for
YafaRay since we again have an active developer who also systematically
takes on bug tracker tasks.  In fact, it has been the year with the
highest number of releases ever. The project is alive but we have
important challenges ahead, particularly recovering the user base,
updating our project documentation and implanting key features in our
software.

\chapter{About SPI}

SPI is a non-profit organization which was founded to help organizations
develop and distribute open hardware and software. We encourage programmers
to use the GNU General Public License or other licenses that allow free
redistribution and use of software, and hardware developers to distribute
documentation that will allow device drivers to be written for their product.

SPI was incorporated as a non-profit organization on June 16, 1997 in the state
of New York. Since then, it has become an umbrella organization for projects
from the community.

In 1999, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the United States government
determined that under section 501 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code SPI
qualifies for 501 (c) (3) (non-profit organization) status under section 509
(a) (1) and 170 (b) (1) (A) (vi). This means that donations made to SPI and its
supported projects should be tax deductible for the American donor.

\chapter{Member Project Reports}

\section{New Associated Projects}

We have continued to see a reasonable level of interest from projects
who wish to become associated with SPI. Over the past year, XXX projects
joined the SPI umbrella as an Associated Project.

\subsection{ArduPilot}

ArduPilot is a cross-platform free software autopilot project for all
types of small robotic vehicles. With a very active developer and user
community ArduPilot provides sophisticated navigation and control for
all types of flying vehicles, boats and ground vehicles.

\subsection{Glucosio}

Glucosio is an open source project dedicated to bringing open source
apps to smartphone, desktop and web in order to help people with
diabetes improve their health outcomes by better self-management of
their disease. At the same time, Glucosio offers the opportunity for
opt-in to crowdsourcing of anonymized health trends and demographics to
support diabetes research. Apps are dual licensed under the GPLv3/MPL
2.0 license.

\subsection{NTPsec}

The NTPsec project is a more secure, hardened, and improved
implementation of Network Time Protocol derived from NTP Classic, Dave
Mills's original. We employ best practices and state-of-the art
technology in code auditing, verification, and testing to deliver code
that can be used with confidence in deployments with the most stringent
security, availability, and assurance requirements.

\subsection{OpenZFS}

OpenZFS is an umbrella project which brings together individuals and
companies that use and improve the ZFS file system, and encourages the
widespread use of ZFS and its development in a true open-source manner.

ZFS is storage software which combines the functionality of traditional
filesystems, volume manager, and more. ZFS include protection against
data corruption, support for high storage capacities, efficient data
compression, snapshots and copy-on-write clones, continuous integrity
checking and automatic repair, remote replication with ZFS send and
receive, and RAID-Z.

\subsection{Torch}

Torch is a scientific computing framework with wide support for machine
learning algorithms that puts GPUs first. It is easy to use and
efficient, thanks to an simple and fast scripting language, Lua, and an
underlying C/CUDA implementation.

\subsection{X.Org}

The X.Org community creates a free and open accelerated graphics stack,
including major components such as the DRM kernel graphics subsystem,
Mesa 3D graphics library, Wayland compositor and the X.Org Window
System.

\appendix
\chapter{About SPI}

SPI is a non-profit organization which was founded to help organizations
develop and distribute open hardware and software. We encourage programmers
to use the GNU General Public License or other licenses that allow free
redistribution and use of software, and hardware developers to distribute
documentation that will allow device drivers to be written for their product.

SPI was incorporated as a non-profit organization on June 16, 1997 in the state
of New York. Since then, it has become an umbrella organization for projects
from the community.

In 1999, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the United States government
determined that under section 501 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code SPI
qualifies for 501 (c) (3) (non-profit organization) status under section 509
(a) (1) and 170 (b) (1) (A) (vi). This means that donations made to SPI and its
supported projects should be tax deductible for the American donor.

\chapter{Member Project Reports}

\section{New Associated Projects}

We have continued to see a reasonable level of interest from projects who
wish to become associated with SPI.  However, no new project joined the
SPI umbrella as an associated project in 2015.


\section{Updates from Associated Projects}

\subsection{0 A.D.}

0 A.D. (pronounced ``zero ey-dee'') is a cross-platform, real-time strategy
(RTS) game of ancient warfare. It's a historically-based war/economy game,
in which the player must lead an ancient civilization, gather resources
from the map, and raise a military force to conquer enemy factions. 0 A.D.
is open source software licensed under the GPL, and its art and sound
assets are licensed under CC BY-SA. It is developed by Wildfire Games, a
global community of game developers.

Between 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2015, we put out two alpha releases,
each available for Windows, OS X, Linux, and BSD, including long awaited
features such as the ability to capture buildings, a replay mode,
performance improvements, and more. We were able to make much of this
progress thanks to the server which is funded thanks to our donations via
SPI. In addition, we delivered perks including posters, t-shirts and CDs to
our generous donors.

\subsection{Chakra}

Chakra is a GNU/Linux distribution with an emphasis on KDE and Qt
technologies that focuses on simplicity from a technical standpoint and
free software.  Chakra has seen several improvements over the past year,
such as new contributors joining our community, two releases having been
made, a switch from KDE SC 4 to Plasma 5, a switch from Tribe to Calamares
as the installation software and finally adding UEFI support.

\subsection{Debian}

Debian remains attached to its Social Contract and places users and free
software community interests first in its priorities: Debian 8 `Jessie'
was released with more than 43,000 packages and 10 computer architectures.
Additionally, the project continued its efforts to run the LTS program for
extended security support.  To celebrate Jessie's release, many parties
were organised all over the world.

To protect its work, the Debian project announced the Copyright
Aggregation Project with Software Freedom Conservancy.  On behalf of the
Debian community, Conservancy can now safeguard the long term interests of
Debian and its commitment to software freedom.

Some Debian contributors were awarded in 2015.  Stefano Zacchiroli, a
former Debian Project Leader, received an O'Reilly Open Source Award at
OSCON for his contributions to Debian and the FOSS community.  And Holger
Levsen and Jérémy Bobbio were funded by The Linux Foundation's Core
Infrastructure Initiative to advance their Debian work on reproducible
builds.

On 16th August 2015, the Debian project celebrated its 22nd anniversary.
This is a new milestone for the project and makes it one of the oldest
Free and Open Source GNU/Linux distributions.  Its annual DebConf
gathering was held in Heidelberg and set a new attendance record with more
than 550 people.  During DebConf, the new Debian Outreach team welcomed 17
students selected to be part of the Google Summer of Code, two of them
being Outreachy applicants.

The year closed with very sad news for the Debian community.  On December
28th, Debian lost the founder of its community and project, Ian Murdock.
The Debian community is thankful to Ian and will protect his legacy by
widening Debian's community and reach and standing up for free software.

\subsection{Drizzle}

While the Drizzle server is no longer actively developed, the Drizzle JDBC
driver was actively maintained.  This driver has a use use case as a
permissively licensed JDBC driver supporting MySQL.

\subsection{FFmpeg}

FFmpeg is a complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and
stream audio and video. It is used as the platform foundation of many
projects dealing with multimedia, both open source and proprietary, and
used extensively by several multimedia web-based multimedia conversion and
processing services.

In 2015 FFmpeg delivered three main releases (2.6, 2.7, 2.8) and several
security updates of old releases. A complete list of changes can be
\href{http://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=blob_plain;f=Changelog;hb=HEAD}{found
in the changelog}.

FFmpeg participated as a member of Google Summer of Code 2015.

\subsection{GNU TeXmacs}

The TeXmacs project continued to working on the release of TeXmacs 2.1,
which involves a lot of code stabilization and adapting it to new
technology, such as retina displays.  New features include the ability to
use arbitrary Type 1 fonts for mathematical typesetting, as well as many
improvements for the presentation mode, and better support for animations.

{\em Submitted by Joris van der Hoeven}

\subsection{Jenkins}

2015 has been a great year for the Jenkins project. We've reached the
milestone of 10 years, 1000 plugins, and 100K installations, and we also
kicked Jenkins 2.0 in motion, which is a first major version number
increase in this project.

{\em Submitted by Kohsuke Kawaguchi}

\subsection{LibreOffice}

The Document Foundation (TDF) welcomed the City of Munich and RusBITech,
which is based in Moscow, as Advisory Board members, while the
Documentation Liberation Project (DLP) celebrated its first birthday in
April. In July, the Open Document Format version 1.2 was published as
International Standard 26300:2015 by ISO/IEC.

LibreOffice became 5 years old in 2015, and took major steps forward with
two feature-packed releases: LibreOffice 4.4 in January and LibreOffice 5.0
in August, regular updates, and the release of LibreOffice Viewer for
Android devices.

In September, TDF organised the LibreOffice Conference in Aarhus, Denmark,
to bring together developers and users to work on code, share ideas and
discuss the future of the project. The conference was also an opportunity
for TDF board and staff to meet in person.

\subsection{OFTC}

OFTC has been in a mostly steady state over the past years, i.e. the IRC
network was up and running, without much newsworthy things happening.
Lately, we've started modernizing our infrastructure, moving much of the
config management to Puppet, replacing the certificates issued by the aged
SPI certificate authority by modern Let's Encrypt certificates, and
generally looking into making the network more resilient against single
points of failure.

\subsection{PostgreSQL}

PostgreSQL continues to thrive, attract developers and grow its community.
In 2015 we successfully held multiple conferences that showed growth and
promise for the future including but not limited to: PgConf.US, PgConf.EU,
PgConf.DE, PgDay SCALE, PgDay UK, PgDay.FR, Nordic PGday and more! Further
we developed what is arguably our most important release to date, 9.5
(released in January 2016). In 2016 we expect 9.6 to be released and our
upward momentum to continue.

{\em Submitted by Joshua D. Drake}

\subsection{Privoxy}

In 2015 the Privoxy project published one stable releases (3.0.23) which
did not contain any major new features.

Compared to previous years development has slowed down a bit.  Due to
various issues with the hosting service a fair amount of developer time
was spent on finding an alternative that would allow Privoxy developers to
concentrate on development again.

{\em Submitted by Fabian Keil}

\subsection{The Mana World}

The Mana World has been able to gain more independence as a project in
2015. The community has raised enough money to pay its costs. The overall
costs were reduced by SPI taking over as registrar and DNS and Let's
Encrypt issuing SSLs. TMWC (The Mana World Committee) has formed an board
to manage TMW as a NGO/Brand, pay bills, inter-project coordination, etc.
We've had steady contributions and major progress towards project
development goals. We pushed multiple versions with numerous outstanding
bugs/requests, increased our amount of content while maintaining or
reducing the code base, continuing to train developers and adding new
developers to the project as well. TMW also made a serious and successful
brand push in 2015; Tying all various social platforms/mediums together,
added responsive web design, updated website to use schema.org, focused on
cross-device usability. Socially the project has become progressive; Adding
non-binary to the list of playable genders in-game, active members of staff
trying to moderate a massively multiplayer game (MMO) as a safe space (free
of hate speech or oppressive behaviors). Active members include a wide and
diverse array of human beings on the planet and manage to co-exist.

\appendix
\chapter{About SPI}

SPI is a non-profit organization which was founded to help organizations
develop and distribute open hardware and software. We encourage programmers
to use the GNU General Public License or other licenses that allow free
redistribution and use of software, and hardware developers to distribute
documentation that will allow device drivers to be written for their product.

SPI was incorporated as a non-profit organization on June 16, 1997 in the state
of New York. Since then, it has become an umbrella organization for projects
from the community.

In 1999, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the United States government
determined that under section 501 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code SPI
qualifies for 501 (c) (3) (non-profit organization) status under section 509
(a) (1) and 170 (b) (1) (A) (vi). This means that donations made to SPI and its
supported projects should be tax deductible for the American donor.

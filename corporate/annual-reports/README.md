# Creation of the annual report

The following needs to be done to create the annual report:

* Update membership statistics: there's an annual email that sends out stats at the end of the year
* Update board composition for the beginning and end of the year
* Update officers
* Add elections information
* Add new projects with a brief description
* Add projects that left SPI
* Add projects updates for the calendar year: email all projects, ask for an update; remind them several times...
* Ask the President to write summary for the President's Welcome
* Update logo page (for projects that were added and removed): Valessio Brito <<contato@valessiobrito.com.br>> has helped with this in the past

\section{Board Changes}

Changes that occurred during the year:

\begin{itemize}

\item Joerg Jaspert resigned from the board in February 2018 due to
lack of time.  We'd like to thank Joerg for his contributions!

\item The board appointed R. Tyler Croy as an interim director in March
2018.

\item Luca Filipozzi generously offered to resign early to reset the
election of board members to three per year. SPI typically elects three
(out of nine) board members each year but this got out of sync over the
years.

\item The terms for R. Tyler Croy and Michael Schultheiss expired in
July 2018.

\item Croy, Filipozzi and Schultheiss sought re-election.  Filipozzi and
Schultheiss were re-elected.  Stephen Frost joined the board as part of
the same election.

\item On August 13, 2018 the board voted to appoint the following
officers:

\begin{itemize}
\item President: Jimmy Kaplowitz
\item Vice President: Luca Filipozzi
\item Secretary: Tim Potter
\item Treasurer: Michael Schultheiss
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\chapter{About SPI}

SPI is a non-profit organization which was founded to help organizations
develop and distribute open hardware and software. We encourage programmers
to use the GNU General Public License or other licenses that allow free
redistribution and use of software, and hardware developers to distribute
documentation that will allow device drivers to be written for their product.

SPI was incorporated as a non-profit organization on June 16, 1997 in the state
of New York. Since then, it has become an umbrella organization for projects
from the community.

In 1999, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the United States government
determined that under section 501 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code SPI
qualifies for 501 (c) (3) (non-profit organization) status under section 509
(a) (1) and 170 (b) (1) (A) (vi). This means that donations made to SPI and its
supported projects should be tax deductible for the American donor.

\section{New Associated Projects}

\subsection{Compile Farm}

\href{https://cfarm.tetaneutral.net/}{Compile Farm} is a volunteer-run project that maintains a distributed network of diverse computing resources for developers of software with OSI-approved licenses. Machines are owned and hosted by third party sponsors.

The Compile Farm Project traces its roots to a 2005 initiative by Laurent Guerby to make a wide range of computers with numerous architectures available to GCC developers. FSF France was an early sponsor.

Today, it remains a 100\% independent and volunteer-driven project, not affiliated with any sponsors or projects such as FSF, GNU, LLVM, GCC, BSD, Linux, ARM, Intel, AMD, or IBM.

\subsection{POCO: C++ Portable Components}

\href{https://pocoproject.org/}{POCO} is a collection of powerful cross-platform C++ libraries for building network- and internet-based applications that run on desktop, server, mobile, IoT, and embedded systems.

The POCO C++ Libraries have been trusted worldwide since 2005 by educators to teach the principles of programming and C++ language in education, as well as by C++ developers to build open source products and mission-critical industrial applications in a wide variety of industries.

The main goal of the project is to increase programmers' productivity by providing the missing abstractions on top of the C++ language and Standard Library, while paying attention to retain the benefits of a mature and performance-oriented programming language that C++ is.

\section{Updates from Associated Projects}

\subsection{0 A.D.}

\href{https://play0ad.com/}{0 A.D.} (pronounced ``zero ey-dee'') is a cross-platform, real-time strategy (RTS) game of ancient warfare. To win the game, one must lead an ancient civilization, gather resources, and raise a military force to defeat enemy factions. 0 A.D. is open-source software licensed under the GPL, and its art and sound assets are licensed under CC BY-SA. The game has been under continuous development by Wildfire Games, a global community of game developers, for over two decades.

In 2023, the development team worked on numerous improvements to the game engine. These include performance improvements, and upgrades of third-party libraries. Most importantly, the engine now features an experimental Vulkan graphics backend, which provides improved access to the capabilities of recent hardware. This component has received a lot of polishing work throughout the year so that we can do just that. We also tweaked the gameplay balancing to increase the variety of playing experiences.

Beyond the technical and gameplay improvements, we continued work on the organizational level as well. We began preparations for a new release of the game in 2023, but decided to put it on hold while we try to strengthen our development process. Much underground work has been performed to migrate our development environment to Git and this work continues into 2024. We hope that this modernization of our environment will make our work less energy-consuming and will facilitate the recruitment of new contributors. During the year, team members also attended some FOSS community events, most notably FOSDEM 2023.

We wish to extend our thanks to our generous donors and to SPI for helping us achieve this progress.

\subsection{Adélie Linux}

\href{https://www.adelielinux.org/}{Adélie} is a lightweight, musl-based, independent Linux platform for desktop and server use, committed to integrity, privacy, and user freedom.

The Adélie Linux distribution continued to deliver on its commitments. In 2023, we released our fifth beta, which brought Xfce live media, {\tt aarch64} installation media, a full set of {\tt armv7} package binaries and installation media, multi-platform Docker images, and an improved guided installer.

Over 2500 commits by 21 authors, more than double the previous year, went into this release. New tooling makes it possible to cut nightly development images and onboard new developers with ease. Generous sponsors and donors have exceeded our immediate hardware needs.

RISC-V is on the official roadmap.

Thank you to our \href{https://git.adelielinux.org/groups/adelie/-/group_members}{team}, our \href{https://www.adelielinux.org/sponsors/}{sponsors}, and our users for being part of it. Follow our \href{https://blog.adelielinux.org/}{blog} and \href{https://www.adelielinux.org/contact/}{social media accounts} to stay informed about our progress.

\subsection{Ankur.org.in}

In 2023 the group at \href{http://ankur.org.in/}{Ankur.org.in project} continued with the work on engaging with stakeholders in government and policy development around the digitisation of content. Additionally, the group has been focused on capacity building for computer literacy among senior citizens who have literacy and numeracy challenges.

In the past year we have participated in digital campaigns focused on building tools which help users identify synthetic content in the local language. In the near future we hope to expand this from merely text based content to audio and video content as well. This is of course subject to some grant proposals being considered by funding organisations.

\subsection{Arch Linux}

\href{https://archlinux.org/}{Arch Linux} is a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution that tries to Keep It Simple. In 2023, the Arch Linux project achieved significant milestones across technological advancements, infrastructure improvements, and community engagement.

We have successfully migrated our packaging ecosystem to Git, with package sources now accessible on GitLab. This transition marks a major enhancement in our workflow, supported by the development of a powerful new tool called \href{https://man.archlinux.org/man/pkgctl.1}{pkgctl}. Available through devtools, pkgctl offers a user-centric design and a streamlined experience for both users and packagers, facilitating seamless interaction with all aspects of Arch Linux packaging.

Building upon the successful migration of our packaging sources to Git, we have also transitioned our bug tracking from Flyspray to GitLab. Bug reports and Merge Requests for packages or Arch Linux projects can now be managed on GitLab, enabling our contributors a modern and streamlined experience.

A lot of effort also went into various of our core projects, resulting in numerous releases. Projects such as ArchISO, arch-boxes, archinstall, mkinitcpio and many more have seen multiple updates introducing new features and enhancements.

The Arch Summit 2023 on November 4th and 5th brought together Arch Linux staff and invited guests for discussions on critical aspects of our distro.  Additionally, our participation in FOSDEM facilitated further community outreach and engagement.

\subsection{Debian}

During 2023, \href{https://www.debian.org/}{Debian} turned 30 years old. We marked this occasion with plenty of cake and celebrations all over the world.

We also released Debian 12 (bookworm), which is a landmark release for us, since it's the first time that we've included non-free firmware on our installation media. Over recent years, installing Debian on physical hardware has become cumbersome to impossible without these firmware blobs, so while we still believe in our mission of free software, this has become necessary to allow Debian to be installed on physical hardware.

In our tradition of updating our stable releases, we've also released 3 stable point releases for Debian 11 (bullseye), as well as 3 stable point releases for Debian 12 (bookworm).

We gained 20 new Debian Developers, and 25 new Debian Maintainers who we hope will also become full project members in the future.

\subsection{MPI Forum}

The Message Passing Interface (MPI) API is one of the most widely used programming abstractions for High-Performance Computing (HPC) and is used on basically all HPC systems world-wide. Its specification is curated and advanced by the \href{https://www.mpi-forum.org/}{MPI Forum}, a group of volunteers from industry, academia, compute centers and national laboratories, which meets regularly to discuss technical and strategic directions of MPI. Further, the work is connected to the yearly EuroMPI conference, an academic conference with presentations on new directions and evaluations of the current standard. Both, the MPI Forum and the EuroMPI conference series are part of the Software in the Public Interest (SPI).

On the forum side, the MPI forum ratified the latest MPI standard, Version 4.1, on November 2, 2023, and made it available publicly. This updated version includes new features, such as automatic message buffering, memory management for accelerated systems, and improved error handling, alongside many clarifications and readability improvements. Implementations of these new features is on its way in most MPI distributions and are either already available to the user community or will be soon. In addition to many online meetings, the forum also met two times in hybrid fashion, with physical locations in Boston, USA (March 2023) and Bristol, UK (September 2023).

On the EuroMPI side, the conference was held last year from September 11-13, 2023, in Bristol. It was hosted by the University of Bristol and held in conjunction with both an MPI Forum meeting and the annual IWOMP conference, which is an academic conference that focuses on a closely related standard in HPC, called OpenMP. MPI and OpenMP have many synergies so they have been meeting back-to-back at the same venue for several years. The combined conferences featured 32 speakers and were attended by 83 researchers, and were, once again, an ideal place for discussions on future directions of MPI and its related technologies.

The \href{https://www.open-bio.org/}{Open Bioinformatics Foundation} (OBF), founded in 2001, is a non-profit, volunteer-run group that promotes open source development and open science in biological research. OBF is led by an \href{https://open-bio.org/board/ }{elected Board that currently includes 9 members}, with Peter Cock as the president. There have been no changes to the OBF Board in the past year.  During our public Board meeting on 2023-12-19, three board members were re-elected: Peter Cock (President), Heather Wiencko (Treasurer), and Hilmar Lapp (Member at Large).

In 2023, OBF awarded 6 Event Fellowships over three rounds, as part of its program to increase diverse participation at events that promote open science.

On March 14, 2023, the OBF hosted an ISCBacademy webinar in which Hannah Wei -- co-founder of the Patient-Led Research Collaborative–-- gave a talk on ``Re-Thinking the Patient's Role in a Learning Health System: Lessons from the Patient-Led Research Collaborative'' (\href{https://youtu.be/M2vAotWKd_Q}{video}). Another ISCBacademy webinar on October 3, 2023, which was jointly sponsored by the Bio-Ontologies COSI, featured Sierra Moxon speaking about ``LinkML: an open data modeling framework, grounded with ontologies'' (\href{https://youtu.be/CwyncsMMdNA}{video}).

OBF's annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference, BOSC 2023, was part of ISMB/ECCB 2023 (in Lyon, France, and online). ISMB/ECCB 2023 attracted a near-record number of attendees, with over 2100 in person and about 900 more online. Approximately 200 people participated in BOSC sessions. In addition to 43 talks and 49 posters, BOSC 2023 featured two keynotes: Sara El-Gebali, who spoke about ``A New Odyssey: Pioneering the Future of Scientific Progress Through Open Collaboration'' and Joseph Yracheta, who spoke about ``The Dissonance between Scientific Altruism \& Capitalist Extraction: The Zero Trust and Federated Data Sovereignty Solution''. A joint session brought together BOSC and the Bio-Ontologies COSI. The conference closed with a panel on Open and Ethical Data Sharing. It was preceded by the BOSC/OBF CollaborationFest, a collaborative work event that brought together about 40 participants interested in synergistically combining ideas, shaping project plans, developing software, and more.

BOSC 2024, the 25th annual BOSC, will take place July 15-16, 2024, in Montréal, Canada (with an online option), and will be followed by a CollaborationFest.

\subsection{PMIx}

The \href{https://pmix.github.io/}{PMIx organization} is a collection of academics, researchers, and vendors who develop and maintain cutting-edge technology for deploying, managing and improving interoperability between most-demanding High Performance Computing (HPC) environmental management software, notably for the deployment and runtime management of distributed applications, and their interoperability with launch managers and batch schedulers. The organization supports the development and release of the PMIx standard, and is closely associated with the Open PMIx and PRTE reference implementations.

In 2023:

\begin{itemize}

\item The organization held 4 Administrative Steering Committee meetings. The meetings include all stakeholders during two 3 hour sessions, during which the eligible members of the ASC vote on inclusion and modification of the PMIx standard document. The organization also held elections to renew its chairs and secretaries, as well as updated bylaw documents.

\item Multiple working groups have been active and proposed amendments to the standard with respect to 1) making the document implementation neutral, better separating API and concepts from the reference implementation design; 2) introducing an ABI to enhance the portability of PMIx application and system services; 3) the expansion of the standard to support malleable applications, that is, applications that can react to runtime changes to the number of available allocated resources.

\item During the reporting period, the organization published two new revisions of the PMIx Standard. PMIx v5.0, is a feature revision of the standard including the standardized ABI. PMIx v4.2 is a bugfix release that backports some of the errata changes from v5.0 to the backward compatible v4 line of standard.

\end{itemize}

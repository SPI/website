# Position statement for Bdale Garbee

I would be pleased to stand for re-election to the SPI board of
directors for another term, and if elected am willing to be re-elected
President if that should please the board.

Biographical information about me is available at many locations on the
web, including http://www.gag.com/bdale/bio/bdale_bio.txt.

The total loss of my home to forest fire in Colorado in early June has
temporarily drawn my attention away from many things including SPI, but
now that we have secured an apartment to live in while our house is
rebuilt, life is rapidly "returning to normal" and I do not expect there
to be any future negative consequences for my involvement in SPI.

I have long considered the role SPI plays in the Free Software ecosystem
vital, and am pleased to play a small role helping ensure SPI remains
able to serve our associated projects faithfully and well.  I'm proud of
how SPI has grown in recent years, and look forward to tackling the
challenges that will inevitably face us in the future.

# Craig Small

### Statement

Hello,

My name is Craig Small and I'm nominating myself for a position on
the SPI Inc board.  I have been a Debian developer and a Free
Software programmer for many years, my first generally released
software was GPL licensed in 1994 though I'd written other stuff
before then.

During the day I'm a network engineering consultant for two service
providers during most of the network architectural work which
includes setting up the operations centres, all with mostly or
totally free software of course!  I am also someone who believes
civil liberties need protecting and are a board member of the
[EFA](http://www.efa.org.au/), which is an organisation
with similar goals, but separate to, the EFF which I'm sure a lot of
you have heard of. I understand how a board on a volunteer
organisation operates.

I might have a different position to most of the other candidates,
my primary goal is to have a stable legal entity to assist the
Debian and other SPI projects do what they do well, which was one of
the original reasons for setting SPI up in the first place.  If
elected to the board and the consensus of the board is to expand
SPI's goals, I will assist them if it doesn't detract from the
current projects.

Happy Voting!

# Bruce Perens Platform

I am running for re-election to SPI's board of directors.

I started this organization, although of course I was assisted by many
people and there have been many others who have done essential work for
it. I played an essential role in the early stages of Debian, and am the
creator and primary author of the Debian Social Contract.

I know of few people who do as much for Free Software as I. You can see
that on my resume at
[http://perens.com/Bio.html](http://perens.com/Bio.html) . Richard Stallman
does more, indeed he dedicates his entire life to it to the exclusion of
all else. For that we should honor him. I am a husband and the parent of
a wonderful six-year-old, and that's mission #1. Hopefully you are
satisfied with Free Software being #2.

Currently I am funded by Sourcelabs to spend half of my work time on
Free Software issues of my own choice, following my own agenda without
their interference. They also pick up my travel bills. I hope to
eventually transition to working full-time on Free Software policy issues.

This year, and for the foreseeable future, my primary mission is to help
fight Software Patents. Recent examples of my work to shift opinion on
the topic are at
[http://technocrat.net/d/2006/6/30/5032](http://technocrat.net/d/2006/6/30/5032/) and
[http://technocrat.net/d/2006/4/5/2073](http://technocrat.net/d/2006/4/5/2073)
You might want to look at my book series at
[http://phptr.com/perens](http://phptr.com/perens). 24
books have been published so far under an Open Content license, and most
of them are now available for source and unencrypted PDF download.

I've missed SPI board meetings reasonably often because I'm in the air
or at a meeting on Free Software community business. As most of the real
business of SPI is on a mailing list, that's not been too bad. The
hardest part of SPI is the treasurer's job, and that's not one I'm
well-suited for. I am, however, encouraged by the progress in moving much
of this work to paid professionals.

Please call me at (US) 510-526-1165, or write to me at bruce @
perens.com if you would like to discuss anything. I hope to meet you
soon at a Free Software event.

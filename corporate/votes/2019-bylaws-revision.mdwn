# 2019 By-laws Revision

The existing SPI by-laws do not meet the current practical operational
needs of SPI. Over the last several years the Board has prepared a
replacement by-laws document that better suits the SPI and its
members. Several rounds of member feedback have occurred and have been
incorporated into the replacement bylaws document, as as legal advice
to ensure compliance with applicable law.

The full text of the proposed by-laws can be found at
[spi-proposed-bylaws.pdf](spi-proposed-bylaws.pdf). (SHA256

The Board asks SPI members to consult the [FAQ](bylaws-revision-faq/)
for answers to common questions about this proposed change.

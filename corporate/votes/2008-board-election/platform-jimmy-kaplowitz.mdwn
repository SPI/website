# Platform for Jimmy Kaplowitz

I've served on the SPI board from February 2004 through July 2007, and
again since February 2008. For all but the last year of my first stint
on the board, I also served as Treasurer, starting the process of
getting SPI's finances in order which Josh Berkus and Michael
Schultheiss have continued. I've been good (though not perfect)
regarding attendance and informed participation at SPI's meetings; I
plan to continue that and will give the new board my mobile phone number
to increase the ease of reaching me if I am AWOL.

During my time on the board, I have advocated transparency of the board
to its membership, successfully proposing a resolution to make it
explicit that the board should conduct all its communications in the
most open way that is appropriate for the subject at hand. I plan to
continue increasing the transparency of SPI, and will to that end
implement a solution to automate meeting reminder emails. I may run for
the position of Secretary for this purpose if elected to the board. In
that case, I hope to resurrect the practice of emailing approved
resolutions and meeting minutes to the spi-announce list as happened in
the past.

Feel free to contact me with any further questions, either on the
spi-general or spi-private lists, or privately at jimmy@spi-inc.org.

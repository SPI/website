# Position statement for Martin Michlmayr

I'm Martin Michlmayr (tbm on IRC), and I am standing for re-election to the SPI board.

I've been an active contributor to the free software and open source community for many years, often focusing on non-technical aspects.  I acted as the Debian Project Leader for two years and in this capacity served as an advisor to Software in the Public Interest.  Between April 2008 and March 2014, I served on the board of directors of the Open Source Initiative (OSI).  During this time, I gained a lot of experience on how non-profit organizations work.

I joined the SPI board in 2014 and served as Secretary for two years and as President for one year.  I believe SPI serves an important role in the FOSS ecosystem by supporting and offering various services to projects.  During the time I've been on the board, we've made a lot of improvements, such as to the effectiveness of the board (successful face-to-face meetings to tackle outstanding issues and talk about the roadmap; onboarding information for directors) and the financial system (the move to ledger-cli ; obtaining paid help for reimbursements).

I seek re-election to the SPI board in order to continue to improve SPI's operations and to contribute to SPI's mission to serve the associated projects.

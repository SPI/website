### Statement

I work on and advocate Free Software such as Debian GNU, Linux and
others, lead the German ffis e.V., talk to people about Free Software,
organise exhibitions, conferences and workshops in order to support and
promote Free Software.  I'm not going to list everything.  Interested
people should just Google for my name.

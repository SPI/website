# Position statement for Milan Kupcevic

I'm Milan Kupcevic, a Debian developer, an SPI contributing member and a
life long proponent of free and open source software who believes in the
purpose of this organization. Moreover, my personal interests, as well
as my professional career, gravitate around open projects and platforms
that value freedom, learning and knowledge sharing. Besides maintaining
a number of software packages, I have attended Debian developer
conferences in New York, Banja Luka, Managua, Vaumarcus, Portland,
Heidelberg, Cape Town, Montreal, Hsinchu, and Curitiba as well as local
gatherings around LibrePlanet in Boston.

Recognizing the importance of cultivating a nurturing environment for
the projects under the umbrella SPI has to offer, I would gladly help
this organization achieve and maintain excellence in its core mission
and secure smooth technical and operational procedures. I would also aim
to elevate visibility and promote SPI's mission to the wider public and
recruit new contributors, projects and sponsors.

I'm looking forward to join the board of directors of the Software in
the Public Interest corporation as a general board member. I would be
honored with an opportunity to help directing the course of this
organization.

# Position statement for Tim Potter

Hello. I'm Tim Potter (tpot) and I've been part of the open
source and free software community for nearly 20 years. I would
like to continue to be a member of the SPI Board of
Directors. I've written a lot of code during my career and have a
good understanding of technical and political issues around the
FOSS community and industry. I would like to continue to apply
that knowledge to help the various projects that are members of
SPI.

My position is that as a long-time free software contributor I
feel that I can provide value to the community and SPI in
particular in ways other than coding. My days of caffeine-fueled
all-night hackathons are pretty much over but there is still a
lot of vital non-technical administrative work that needs to be
done for the management of FOSS projects. This is the job of
SPI for its member projects.

I believe that there are still tasks related to running a free
software project that can be outsourced to SPI by member
projects. If re-elected as a member of the SPI board, I would
endeavour to continue the excellent work of SPI under
previous directors over the years, as well as investigating what
other services can be offered to member projects to ease
non-development and other administrative burdens.

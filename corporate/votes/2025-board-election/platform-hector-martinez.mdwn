# Position statement for Héctor Orón Martínez

I have been long time contributor to the FLOSS ecosystem, long time
contributor to the Debian project.

I have also served in the SPI board for several years, being vocal and
later treasurer.

I would like to run for one more term and keep on supporting the SPI
treasuries, which I have planned to improve with better automation for
the associated projects, as well as keep on running the usual operations
for the SPI organization.

Thanks for considering me for this election.

# Position statement for Jonatas Luis Nogueira

Hi, my name is Jonatas although most people might know me as Jesusalva.
I've been involved in open source gaming for over a decade now, most notably in FreedroidRPG and Moubootaur Legends (an open source MMORPG).

I've joined SPI Board in 2022 and been elected vice president in 2024, and I am seeking forward reelection to keep serving the public interest.

Thanks for considering me.

# Position statement for Stephen Frost

I would be happy to serve as a member of the SPI board.

I'm a major contributor and committer to the PostgreSQL project and
president of the United States PostgreSQL Association, a PostgreSQL.Org
recognized community NPO.  I'm on the PostgreSQL Infrastructure team
which runs PostgreSQL.Org.  I'm one of the PostgresOpen operations
committee chairs, the US PostgreSQL Community Conference.

I'm also a Debian Developer and long standing member of SPI.

I'm pleased to see the progress which has been made to improve the SPI
Bylaws and would like to continue to help move SPI forward and to have
it be a valuable and positive resource for open source projects,
including both Debian and PostgreSQL.

Thanks!

Stephen

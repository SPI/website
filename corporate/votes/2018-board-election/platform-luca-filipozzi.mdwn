# Position statement for Luca Filipozzi

I have had the pleasure of serving as a Director on the SPI Board for
two years and have elected to resign one year early to allow for the
alignment of board vacancy schedule (3 per year).

I'm pleased to note that a variety of my process improvement proposals
have been adopted by SPI (DebConf 2017 Reimbursement Process, Traveling
Mailbox for physical mail handling, Google Voice for identification
verification processes, the hiring of a contractor to support accounts
payable processing, etc.).

That said, there's more work to be done &mdash; especially on the IT
side &mdash; and so I am seeking your support in my re-election.

If I'm re-elected and if I'm reappointed to the Vice-President position
by my fellow board members, the IT revamp will be my primary focus for
SPI in the coming year.

I look forward to working with the new Board on this endeavour, while
simultaneously asking for their confirmation of serverless (focus on
using service providers) vs traditional (virtual machines, etc.). Since
consensus has so far not been achieved on this topic, a formal vote will
be required by the Board, after sufficient discussion.

# Position statement for Martin Michlmayr

I'm Martin Michlmayr (tbm on IRC), and I am standing for election to the
SPI board.

I've been an active contributor to the free software and open source
community for many years, often focusing on non-technical aspects.  I acted
as the Debian Project Leader for two years and in this capacity served as
an advisor to Software in the Public Interest.  Between April 2008 and
March 2014, I served on the board of directors of the Open Source
Initiative (OSI).  During this time, I gained a lot of experience on how
non-profit organizations work (and don't work).  I've been a member of
Software Freedom Conservancy's evaluation committee since 2012 and recently
joined its board of directors.  I work for Hewlett-Packard and help to
facilitate FOSS activities both internally within HP as well as externally
within the broader community.

I believe SPI serves an important role in the FOSS ecosystem by supporting
and offering various services to projects.  I seek election to the SPI
board in order to help the organization better serve projects associated
with SPI and to ensure that projects can rely on SPI.

# Martin Zobel-Helas Platform

My name is Martin Zobel-Helas (zobel on IRC), and I hereby nominate
myself as candidate for the upcoming SPI Board of Directors elections.

I have been Debian Developer since August 2005 and contributing SPI member
since March 2006. I have been Debian Stable Release Manager since March 2006
and Release Assistant for testing/unstable since June 2007. I founded
debian-volatile service together with Andi Barth. I co-maintain the
buildd-network for the experimental and non-free part of the Debian
Archive.

If elected as an SPI board member, I will try to achieve a greater degree of
communication between it's member projects. From what I have learned as my
position as Debian Stable Release manager, lots of FLOSS projects are about
communication between subprojects and members it's members.
Coordinating stable releases is more about communication between Debian
Developers and the Debian FTP-Team as actually deciding which package
goes in the release (and which not).

To achieve this communication I would like to help SPI to with the
various press contacts I have within the community to get more attention
from our SPI members.

If you have any questions regarding my person or my platform, feel free
to contact me at &lt;zobel@debian.org&gt; or try to catch me on IRC.

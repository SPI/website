# Position statement for Martin Zobel-Helas

My name is Martin Zobel-Helas (zobel on IRC), and I hereby nominate
myself as candidate for the upcoming SPI Board of Directors elections.

I am Debian Developer since August 2005, contributing SPI member since
March 2006 and SPI board member since August 2007.

Within Debian I work and worked in several positions:

 * Debian Listmaster
 * Debian System Administrator
 * Debian Stable Release team
 * Debian Release Team assistant
 * debian-volatile Team founder
 * debian autobuilding network

As board member of SPI I served as Secretary in 2009.

If elected as an SPI board member, I will try to achieve a greater degree of
communication between it's member projects. From what I have learned as my
position as Debian Stable Release manager, lots of FLOSS projects are about
communication between subprojects and it's members.

If you have any questions regarding my person or my platform, feel free
to contact me at [zobel@debian.org](mailto:zobel@debian.org) or try to
catch me on IRC.

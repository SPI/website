# Position statement for Clint Adams

I am Clint Adams (Clint on irc.oftc.net), and I am standing for
election to the SPI board.

## Why am I running?

Over the past year or so I have become more acquainted with the
workings of many FLOSS-related non-profits.  Given the current
political climate, it seems that in the near term, fiscal
sponsorship organizations will be more important than ever.

In its field, I believe that SPI is the best for most projects
that might want to be under its umbrella; it strikes the right
balance between service and supervision.  Certainly if one of
my projects ever had such a need, I would consider SPI first.

Thus I believe that SPI should continue what it is doing and
continue to grow and accept new member projects.

## About me

I have been a Debian Developer since 1997, a contributing SPI member
since 2001, an ongoing contributor and author of many free software
projects, and a user of many more, including several current SPI
member projects.  I also work with the Software Freedom Law Center,
a 501(c)(3) non-profit that provides pro bono legal services to
free software projects, including SPI and Debian.

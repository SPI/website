# Position statement for Peter Eisentraut

I am Peter Eisentraut, and I seek election to the Board of Directors of
SPI.

I have been a contributor in the PostgreSQL project since 1999 and a
Debian Developer since 2005.  I am currently a member of the core team of
the PostgreSQL project.  In 2006, I had a small role in helping the
PostgreSQL project join SPI.  I work for 2ndQuadrant, a PostgreSQL
consulting firm.  I live with my family on the East Coast of the United
States.  Previously, I have lived in Germany, Finland, and Sweden.

My immediate interest is that SPI continues to serve both the Debian
project and associated projects effectively.

My vote is for continuity with a fresh face.  SPI has a valuable role in
offering free and open-source projects financial and property management
services.  I see my role as a director as working to maintain the trust
that projects have placed in SPI, to ensure accurate and compliant record
keeping, and to make the SPI services available to member projects and
members in a reliable and efficient manner.  I endorse the work of the
existing board and want to help continue it.

# Position statement for Andrew Tridgell

My name is Andrew Tridgell. I have been contributing to numerous free
software projects since 1989, including leadership roles in several
projects (Samba, rsync and ccache for example). For the past few years I
have focussed on the ArduPilot autopilot project where I am a lead
developer.

It is through my involvement with ArduPilot that I have recently joined
SPI, as ArduPilot became an SPI associated project. I am grateful for
the work that SPI does in supporting free software projects, which is
why I am offering my services as a board member.

I am very new to SPI, but I have served on similar boards in the past,
including on the board of Linux Australia and I am a current board
member of DroneCode.

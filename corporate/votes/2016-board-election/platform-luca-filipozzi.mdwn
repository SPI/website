# Position statement for Luca Filipozzi

I am Luca Filipozzi (luca on irc.oftc.net), and I am standing for
election to the SPI board.

I have been an active contributor to the free/libre open source software
community for many years.  I have been a member of Debian since 2000 and
I am one of the founders of OFTC.  I host about 25% of Debian's
infrastructure with my employer and am a member of the Debian System
Administration team.  I have sponsored OFTC infrastructure since the
establishment of OFTC and served on its NOC.  I have attended three
Debian Conferences (Toronto CA, Heidelberg DE, and Cape Town ZA) and two
DSA Sprints (Oslo NO and Essen DE).

I believe in the broad objectives of FLOSS and consider Software in the
Public Interest to be an organization integral to their success.  That
said, there are some structural challenges with the operations of SPI
that require amelioration from the perspective of member projects.
Putting words into action, I offer my time/energy/ideas as an SPI
director to assist.

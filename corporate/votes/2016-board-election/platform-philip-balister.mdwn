# Position statement for Philip Balister

I'm Philip Balister, Crofton on IRC, and I am running for a seat on the
Software in the Public Interest Board.

For the past ten years, I've been a contributor to the OpenEmbedded
Project, an SPI affiliated project. Most of that time I have served as
the chair of the OpenEmbedded board. Over the years, I've learned about
issues important for supporting successful open source projects. During
my time with OpenEmbedded the project grew from its hobbyist roots into
the build system adopted by the Yocto Project. As the OpenEmbedded
contact for SPI, I attend as many SPI board meetings as possible to stay
in touch with SPI and understand the issues it faces.

My goals as a SPI board member would be represent all the affiliated
projects at board meetings. I would like work on assisting all the
member projects make better use of the services SPI provides. I believe
my experience with OpenEmbedded will make me a valuable addition to the
SPI board.

# Position statement for Joerg Jaspert

Who I am: Joerg Jaspert (IRC nick is Ganneff on OFTC/Freenode)

Debian Developer since April 2002 and there I contribute(d) to various
tasks:

* Application Manager between 2002 and 2004
* Account Manager since the end of 2004
* FTP-Team member since 2005
* Maintaining a number of packages
* One of the organisers of DebConf, the annual Debian conference
* Organized several smaller events, booth presences, etc for Debian,
   including merchandising stuff and CD/DVD images for it.
* Contributing SPI member since May 2002, Board member and Vice
   President since 2007
* Many other things.

I am the main SPI admin since 2006 and am a member of the NOC in the
SPI project OFTC.

This will be my 4th term as a board member, should I be re-elected. I
intend to run for Vice-President again, as such keeping the admin head
position for another term. I want to continue my work to help SPI over
the upcoming term, it especially needs a complete refresh of the
"machine park" and setup SPI's infrastructure runs on, as well as
helping some more people to learn/get into the role of SPI admin and
hostmaster, making it less dependent on me.

For any open questions feel free to mail me at <joerg@debian.org> or use
IRC.

# SPI's Request Tracker (RT)

SPI operates an instance of Request Tracker (RT) to keep track of
various outstanding tasks and requests.  If you have a request, you can
open a new ticket by sending an email to one of the following addresses
at the `rt.spi-inc.org` domain:

* sysadmin: for sys admin related requests
* treasurer: for [treasurer](/treasurer/) related requests
* board: for [board](../board/) related requests.  However, please be
  aware that for the majority of board inquiries, we prefer an email
  to the [board list](../board/).

Please put a summary of your request or issue in the `Subject` line of
your email and add a detailed description in the body.

You'll receive an email confirmation with a ticket number.  We'll
respond to your ticket by email.

Tickets in our RT system are not publicly visible since they may contain
sensitive information (e.g. reimbursement requests with receipts and
bank information).  Access is granted to the board and certain
volunteers and contractors (e.g. those dealing with reimbursement
requests).

Do note that all contracts and agreements should preferably be sent to
the Board RT address.

Our RT instance is hosted by [Best Practical Solutions, LLC](https://bestpractical.com/privacy-policy).

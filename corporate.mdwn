# Corporate
            
Since SPI exists for the good of the community, we feel the need to conduct
our business as openly as possible. As such, approved meeting minutes and
resolutions are posted on the web site for all to see. In this manner, we
hope to encourage feedback on the way SPI operates and on its involvement with
the community.

SPI is run by a [Board of Directors](corporate/board), and governed by
its Certificate of Incorporation, its Bylaws, and by the resolutions that
have been passed.

# Membership Info

Anyone is eligible to [apply](https://members.spi-inc.org/) for
membership in Software in the Public Interest, Inc. More information about
the role of membership in the organization is available in section three of
the [SPI Bylaws](../corporate/by-laws/).

There are two types of membership: __non-contributing__
and __contributing__ memberships.

Anyone who agrees with the principles of SPI should consider signing up
for a non-contributing membership. SPI's goal is to reflect the intent
of the free software community and to represent the views of its
membership.

Contributing memberships are open to those who participate actively in
the free software community. These members also have voting power in the
organization. In order to apply for a contributing membership, you have
to [sign up](https://members.spi-inc.org/) for a
non-contributing membership first.

The membership committee has created a set of [guidelines](guidelines/) which
define who is eligible for a contributing membership.

Questions regarding the membership process should be directed to the
[membership committee](mailto:membership@spi-inc.org).

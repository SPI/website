Money that is donated will be distributed to the various 
[projects](/projects) and efforts that SPI is affiliated with, and
to pay for SPI's operating expenses. SPI has no paid staff, but
occasionally retains the services of professionals on a contractual basis
(accountants, bookkeepers, etc.) If you intend for the money you donate to
be used for a specific project or purpose, please note that in the memo
field of your check or money order, or in the body of your email message
for wire transfers. Please note that while SPI does communicate donors'
earmarks to member projects, and sets aside funds for each project's use,
the disposition of funds allocated to a given member project is the
prerogative of that project. Member projects are free to use the funds
allocated to them at their discretion, as long as such usage is consistent
with U.S. laws and regulations, and within the constraints of SPI's 
[certificate of incorporation](/corporate/certificate-of-incorporation) and 
[bylaws](/corporate/by-laws).  

Note that the identities of donors are kept confidential to
SPI, and only disclosed to members of SPI. Some additional
information, such as the donor's city and state of residence,
and amount and type (e.g., check or money order) of donation may
also be disclosed to members of SPI. Donors' full mailing
addresses are retained by the Treasurer but may be disclosed to
the SPI Board of Directors if circumstances require such
disclosure. SPI does not sell the names or addresses of its
donors to any party. SPI does not circulate the names or any
identifying information about donors except among its own
membership (which includes member projects). Members of SPI
are expected to keep such information confidential. All of that
said, these are statements of SPI policy only, and do not
constitute a guarantee or legal contract of any sort between
donors and SPI. If you have concerns about this policy, please
contact the [SPI Board of Directors](mailto:board@spi-inc.org).

If you require a letter from SPI documenting your donation
for tax purposes, please note this fact in a letter enclosed
with your check or money order, and include a self-addressed,
stamped envelope. Please allow 3-4 weeks for paper mail
acknowledgement. Note that this period is above and beyond
delivery time for your donation, and for return mail delivery
time via postal services. SPI accepts no responsibility for
failure of postal services to deliver your tax information.
You may wish to request email acknowledgement in conjunction
with tax information letters (see above).

If you have special needs or questions, please feel free to
contact the [SPI Treasurer][]; however, 
please keep in mind that the duties of the SPI Treasurer are at 
present undertaken by a volunteer, not by a paid employee of 
SPI. Furthermore, communications with the SPI Treasurer may be shared 
with the Board of Directors and/or membership.

## Donations made through employee giving programs

Some companies allow their employees to make donations to SPI or an 
affiliated project as part of their annual charitable giving 
campaigns.  [Hewlett-Packard](http://www.hp.com/) is one such company.

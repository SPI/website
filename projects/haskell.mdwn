[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is an advanced
[purely-functional](https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Functional_programming)
programming language. An open-source product of more than twenty years
of cutting-edge research,
it allows rapid development of robust, concise, correct
software. With strong support for
[integration with other languages](https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Foreign_Function_Interface),
built-in
[concurrency and parallelism](https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Parallel),
debuggers, profilers,
[rich libraries](https://hackage.haskell.org/packages/hackage.html)
and an active community, Haskell makes
it easier to produce flexible, maintainable,
high-quality software.

[Haskell.org](https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell.org_committee)
is the organisation representing the Open Source Haskell community.

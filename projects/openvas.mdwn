[OpenVAS](http://www.openvas.org/) (OpenSource Vulnerability Assesment
Scanner) is a GPL fork of the [Nessus](http://www.nessus.org/) security
scanner currently controlled by Tenable Network Security.

OpenVAS provides a totally open licensed, freely distributable scanning
engine as well as a complete library of plugins and tests which will
scan for particular vulnerabilities. Starting from Nessus version 2.2.5
which was released under a GPL license OpenVAS will continue to develop
and refine the underlying engine as well as expand the plugin script
library and functionality.

# Drizzle

[[!img drizzle-logo.png alt="Drizzle logo" class="projectlogo" link="no"]]

Drizzle was a database server forked from MySQL 6.0 code base. Its
active development phase ranged from 2008 to 2012. In the MySQL
ecosystem of forks, Drizzle focused on heavily refactoring and
modernizing the code base, and moving to a fully open, community driven
development model. Today active development continues in the
[libdrizzle-redux C
library](https://github.com/sociomantic-tsunami/libdrizzle-redux) and
[drizzle-jdbc Java library](https://github.com/krummas/DrizzleJDBC).
Their typical use case is to provide a BSD licensed client library for
the MySQL server.

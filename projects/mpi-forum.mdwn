# MPI Forum

The [MPI Forum](https://www.mpi-forum.org/) is the standardization body for the Message Passing Interface (MPI), a hardware agnostic interface for passing messages for parallel and distributed computing. MPI is implemented in a number of open-source and proprietary libraries and widely used in academic, corporate, and research institutions. The MPI Forum meets regularly to discuss and design the next version of the MPI Standard. The work of the MPI Forum happens in our public [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/mpi-forum), and anyone is welcome to participate by joining the MPI Forum's mailing list and attending our virtual and physical meetings.

The MPI Forum also helps organize the annual EuroMPI conference. This conference is the preeminent meeting for users, developers and researchers to interact and discuss new developments and applications of MPI.

# systemd

[systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) is a suite
of basic building blocks for a Linux system. It provides a system and
service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest of the system.
systemd provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket
and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of
daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux control groups, maintains
mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional
dependency-based service control logic. systemd supports SysV and LSB
init scripts and works as a replacement for sysvinit.

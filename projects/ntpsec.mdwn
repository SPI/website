The [NTPsec project](https://www.ntpsec.org/) is a more secure, hardened,
and improved implementation of Network Time Protocol derived from NTP
Classic, Dave Mills's original.  We employ best practices and state-of-the
art technology in code auditing, verification, and testing to deliver code
that can be used with confidence in deployments with the most stringent
security, availability, and assurance requirements.

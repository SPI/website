Himmelblau was conceived to address the growing need for seamless integration between Linux environments and Microsoft's Azure Entra ID. Himmelblau bridges compatibility barriers, delivering robust Azure Entra ID authentication for Linux systems.

Originating as a fork of the Kanidm OAuth2 client led by William Brown, a SUSE engineer, Himmelblau tailors the Kanidm framework for Azure Entra ID, leveraging its proven reliability for cloud and hybrid authentication.

Help us support OSUNIX to be the first entirely open source OpenSolaris
technology distribution. OSUNIX is based off the graciously open sourced
OpenSolaris(tm) technology from Sun Microsystems(tm). For over a year
OSUNIX developers have been volunteering their time, but now we need
help to push development and engineering to a production level. 91+% of
donations to OSUNIX will be used entirely for the needs of the
community.  (5% goes to SPI and about 4% for processing fee) This
includes sponsoring direct bug fixes, fees to the Open Group, new
features, hardware, improving documentation, travel budget for
developers and training events. Your generosity is greatly appreciated
and if you like the idea behind the project send us a friendly hi.

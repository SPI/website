The [PMIx Standard Community Project](https://pmix.org/) is governed by the PMIx Administrative Steering Committee (ASC). The ASC is a formal body that manages the PMIx Standard, PMIx Governance, and associated documents. The PMIx Standard document defines an API that provides libraries, tools, and resource managers with portable and well-defined access to commonly needed services in high-performance distributed and parallel computing systems. The [PMIx Standard is available on GitHub](https://github.com/pmix/pmix-standard). The PMIx Standard Community, represented by the ASC, is an international body with member organizations spanning industry, government, and academia.

[Tux4Kids](http://tux4kids.alioth.debian.org/) develops high-quality
software for kids, with the goal of combining fun and learning into an
irresistable package. Our software is free: you can download it for use
at home or onto hundreds of computers in a school. We support all major
platforms, including Windows, Macintosh, and Linux/Unix. Our programs
are used by people around the globe, and they have been translated into
dozens of different languages. As open-source software, these programs
can be freely extended or customized, and they are supported by active
communities of volunteer developers.

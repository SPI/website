The X.Org community creates a free and open accelerated graphics stack with
the major components:

* DRM kernel graphics subsystem
* [Mesa 3D](http://www.mesa3d.org/) graphics library
* [Wayland compositor](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/)
* [X.Org Window System](https://x.org/wiki/)
* and many other smaller bits and pieces.

The [X.Org Foundation](https://www.x.org/wiki/XorgFoundation/) itself aims
to support the community as much as possible by organizing and sponsoring
student internships, travel sponsoring to conferences and selecting a new
location and organizers for the annual [X.Org Developer
Summit](https://www.x.org/wiki/Events/).

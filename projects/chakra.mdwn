[Chakra](https://chakraos.org/) is a GNU/Linux distribution with an emphasis on
KDE and Qt technologies that focuses on simplicity from a technical standpoint
and free software. It has a half-rolling release model that aims to provide a
thoroughly tested core layer of software - such as the Linux kernel, GNU
coreutils and common libraries - while the software in the applications layer
is updated more frequently.

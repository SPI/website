# C++ Portable Components (POCO)

[[!img poco-logo.png alt="POCO logo" class="projectlogo" link="yes"]]

[POCO](https://pocoproject.org/) is a collection of powerful cross-platform C++ libraries for building network- and internet-based applications that run on desktop, server, mobile, IoT, and embedded systems.

The POCO C++ Libraries have been trusted worldwide since 2005 by educators to teach the principles of programming and C++ language in education, as well as by C++ developers to build open source products and mission-critical industrial applications in a wide variety of industries.

The main goal of the project is to increase programmers' productivity by providing the missing abstractions on top of the C++ language and Standard Library, while paying attention to retain the benefits of a mature and performance-oriented programming language that C++ is.

[OpenEmbedded](http://www.openembedded.org/), is a build framework for
embedded Linux. OpenEmbedded offers a best-in-class cross-compile
environment. It allows developers to create a complete Linux Distribution
for embedded systems. Some of the OpenEmbedded advantages include:

* support for many hardware architectures
* multiple releases for those architectures
* tools for speeding up the process of recreating the base after changes have been made
* easy to customize
* runs on any Linux distribution
* cross-compiles 1000's of packages including GTK+, Qt, the X Window System, Mono, Java, and about anything else you might ever need

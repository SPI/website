[wxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org/) gives you a single, easy-to-use
API for writing GUI applications on multiple platforms. Link with the
appropriate library for your platform and compiler, and your application
will adopt the look and feel appropriate to that platform. On top of
great GUI functionality, wxWidgets gives you: online help, network
programming, streams, clipboard and drag and drop, multithreading, image
loading and saving in a variety of popular formats, database support,
HTML viewing and printing, and much much more.

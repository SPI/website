[OpenWrt](https://www.openwrt.org/) is a Linux based distribution for
embedded solutions, supporting a very broad list of platforms. Instead
of trying to create a single, static firmware, OpenWrt provides a fully
writable filesystem with package management. This frees and allows you
to customize the device through the use of packages to suit any
application. For both developers and users, OpenWrt is a framework for
building innovative solutions and an open path towards full
customization. It is the goal of OpenWrt to empower development, explore
potentials and to use embedded devices in ways never envisioned. OpenWrt
is currently being used worldwide in both wired and wireless networks
solutions, industrial control systems, small robots, sensor networks,
VoIP systems, and a whole lot more.

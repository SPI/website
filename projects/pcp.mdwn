[Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)](http://pcp.io/) provides a framework and
services to support system-level performance monitoring and management. It
presents a unifying abstraction for all of the performance data in a
system, and many tools for interrogating, retrieving and processing that
data.

PCP is a feature-rich, mature, extensible, cross-platform toolkit
supporting both live and retrospective analysis. The distributed PCP
architecture makes it especially useful for those seeking centralized
monitoring of distributed processing.

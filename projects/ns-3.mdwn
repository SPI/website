[ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org) is a discrete-event, packet-level
network simulator with an emphasis on networking research and
education. Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer
networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP,
and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or
visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research
and education process, because of the ability for simulations to
obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol
design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet
been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is a high degree of
realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application
and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine
environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible;
simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.

[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) is an enterprise-grade
relational database system with over 20 years of development starting at
the University of California, Berkeley. PostgreSQL raises funds through
SPI in the United States, FFIS in Germany, and through other non-profits
elsewhere.

PostgreSQL involvement in SPI is governed by the Fundraising Group.

Officers of the Fundraising Group are:

Robert Treat, Board Observer/Advisor for PostgreSQL
Josh Drake, PostgreSQL Funds Liason

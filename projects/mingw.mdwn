[MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) provides a complete Open Source
programming tool set which is suitable for the development of native
MS-Windows applications, and which do not depend on any 3rd-party
C-Runtime DLLs. (It does depend on a number of DLLs provided by
Microsoft themselves, as components of the operating system; most
notable among these is MSVCRT.DLL, the Microsoft C runtime library.
Additionally, threaded applications must ship with a freely
distributable thread support DLL, provided as part of MinGW itself).

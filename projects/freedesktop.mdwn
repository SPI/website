[freedesktop.org](http://www.freedesktop.org/) is open source / open
discussion software projects working on interoperability and shared
technology for X Window System desktops. The most famous X desktops are
GNOME and KDE, but developers working on any Linux/UNIX GUI technology
are welcome to participate.

freedesktop.org is building a base platform for desktop software on
Linux and UNIX. The elements of this platform have become the backend
for higher-level application-visible APIs such as Qt, GTK+, XUL, VCL,
WINE, GNOME, and KDE. The base platform is both software and standards.

[Libreboot](https://libreboot.org/) is a coreboot distribution (coreboot distro), in the same way that Debian is a Linux distribution. Libreboot provides free, open source (libre) boot firmware based on coreboot, replacing proprietary BIOS/UEFI firmware on specific Intel/AMD x86 and ARM based motherboards, including laptop and desktop computers. It initialises the hardware (e.g. memory controller, CPU, peripherals) and starts a bootloader for your operating system (OS).

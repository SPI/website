# Relationship Between SPI and Associated Projects

## Project Independence

SPI does not own, govern or control the associated projects.  All actions by SPI on behalf of associated projects must comply with relevant 
laws, SPI's By-Laws and 501(c)3 status.  SPI does not prohibit the project having a similar relationship with other organisations.

## Freedom to Leave

The project liaison may decide that the project is leaving SPI at any time.  Any assets and money held by SPI for the project may be 
transferred to a 501(c)3 US non-profit of the liaison's choice, or simply held until expended.

## Liability

SPI does not indemnify associated projects or members.

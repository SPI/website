FreedomBox is a personal server running a free software operating system 
and free applications, designed to create and preserve personal privacy by 
providing a secure platform upon which federated social networks can be 
constructed. 

The software for FreedomBox is being assembled by volunteer programmers 
around the world who believe in Free Software and Free Society.  The
[FreedomBox Foundation](http://freedomboxfoundation.org) founded by Eben 
Moglen coordinates development of a reference implementation.

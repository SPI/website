# FreedomBox

FreedomBox is a project supported by the 
[FreedomBox Foundation](http://freedomboxfoundation.org) 
founded by Eben Moglen.  FreedomBox is a personal server running a free 
software operating system and free applications, designed to create and 
preserve personal privacy by providing a secure platform upon which 
federated social networks can be constructed. 

The software for FreedomBox is being assembled by volunteer programmers 
around the world who believe in Free Software and Free Society, with the
foundation leading development of a reference implementation.

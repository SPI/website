[Glucosio](http://www.glucosio.org) is an open source project dedicated to
bringing open source apps to smartphone, desktop and web in order to help
people with diabetes improve their health outcomes by better
self-management of their disease.  At the same time, Glucosio offers the
opportunity for opt-in to crowdsourcing of anonymized health trends and
demographics to support diabetes research. Apps are dual licensed under the
GPLv3/MPL 2.0 license.

Glucosio is self-governed by a meritocratic module structure overseen by
its project leader and is supported by the Glucosio Foundation.

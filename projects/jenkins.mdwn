# Jenkins

<center>![Jenkins](../jenkins-logo.png)</center>

[Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) monitors executions of
repeated jobs, such as building a software project or jobs run by cron.
Among those things, current Jenkins focuses on the following two jobs:

1. _Building/testing software projects continuously_, just like
   CruiseControl or DamageControl. In a nutshell, Jenkins provides an
   easy-to-use so-called continuous integration system, making it easier
   for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it easier
   for users to obtain a fresh build. The automated, continuous build
   increases the productivity.
2. _Monitoring executions of externally-run jobs_, such as cron jobs
   and procmail jobs, even those that are run on a remote machine. For
   example, with cron, all you receive is regular e-mails that capture the
   output, and it is up to you to look at them diligently and notice when
   it broke. Jenkins keeps those outputs and makes it easy for you to
   notice when something is wrong.

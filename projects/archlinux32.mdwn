[Arch Linux 32](https://archlinux32.org) is a community driven fork of
Arch Linux, adding 32-bit support to the general purpose GNU/Linux
distribution versatile enough to suit any role. Development focuses on
simplicity, minimalism, and code elegance. Arch is installed as a
minimal base system, configured by the user upon which their own ideal
environment is assembled by installing only what is required or
desired for their unique purposes. GUI configuration utilities are not
officially provided, and most system configuration is performed from
the shell by editing simple text files. Arch strives to stay bleeding
edge, and typically offers the latest stable versions of most
software.

Arch Linux uses its own Pacman package manager, which couples simple
binary packages with an easy-to-use package build system. This allows
users to easily manage and customize packages ranging from official
Arch software to the user's own personal packages to packages from 3rd
party sources. The repository system also allows users to easily build
and maintain their own custom build scripts, packages, and
repositories, encouraging community growth and contribution.

The minimal Arch base package set resides in the streamlined [core]
repository. In addition, the official [extra], [community], and
[testing] repositories provide several thousand high-quality, packages
to meet your software demands. Arch also offers an [unsupported]
section in the Arch Linux User Repository (AUR), which contains over
9,000 build scripts, for compiling installable packages from source
using the Arch Linux makepkg application.

Arch Linux 32 uses a "rolling release" system which allows one-time
installation and perpetual software upgrades. It is not generally
necessary to reinstall or upgrade your Arch Linux 32 system from one
"version" to the next. By issuing one command, an Arch Linux 32 system
is kept up-to-date and on the bleeding edge.

Arch Linux32 strives to keep its packages as close to Arch Linux and
thus to the original upstream software as possible. Patches are
applied only when necessary to ensure an application compiles and runs
correctly with the other packages installed on an up-to-date Arch
Linux 32 system.

To summarize: Arch Linux 32 is a versatile, and simple distribution
designed to fit the needs of the competent Linux® user. It is both
powerful and easy to manage, making it an ideal distro for servers and
workstations. Take it in any direction you like. If you share this
vision of what a GNU/Linux distribution should be, then you are
welcomed and encouraged to use it freely, get involved, and contribute
to the community.

# Fresco

[Fresco](http://www.fresco.org/) is a windowing system derived from a
powerful structured graphics toolkit originally based on InterViews.
Fresco extends earlier incarnations to the status of a full windowing
system, in command of the video hardware (via GGI, SDL, DirectFB or
GLUT) and processing user input directly rather than peering with a host
windowing system.

Additionally, Fresco's extensions include a rich drawing interface with
multiple backends, an upgrade to modern CORBA standards, a new
Unicode-capable text system, dynamic module loading, and many
communication abstractions for connecting other processes to the server.
It is developed entirely by volunteers on the internet, using free
software, and released under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

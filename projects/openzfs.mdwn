[OpenZFS](http://open-zfs.org) is an umbrella project which brings together
individuals and companies that use and improve the ZFS file system, and
encourages the widespread use of ZFS and its development in a true
open-source manner.

ZFS is storage software which combines the functionality of traditional
filesystems, volume manager, and more.  ZFS include protection against data
corruption, support for high storage capacities, efficient data
compression, snapshots and copy-on-write clones, continuous integrity
checking and automatic repair, remote replication with ZFS send and
receive, and RAID-Z.

OpenZFS brings together developers from the illumos, Linux, FreeBSD and OS
X platforms, and a wide range of companies -- both online and at the annual
OpenZFS Developer Summit. High-level goals of the project include raising
awareness of the quality, utility and availability of open-source
implementations of ZFS, encouraging open communication about ongoing
efforts toward improving open-source variants of ZFS, and ensuring
consistent reliability, functionality and performance of all distributions
of ZFS.

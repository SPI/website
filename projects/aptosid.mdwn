[aptosid](http://www.aptosid.com/) is an operating system based on Debian
GNU/Linux.
 
Building upon Debian's unstable branch, aptosid releases a set of images 4
times a year suitable for live use and focusing on hard disk
installations. These images contain only free software meeting Debian's
Free Software Guidelines (DFSG), come in KDE and XFCE editions for both
the 686 and amd64 architectures and extend Debian with aptosid's own
packages, scripts and kernel for detection of very recent hardware.
 
aptosid aims for a simple and fast installation process and to provide a
reliable entry to the unstable branch of Debian.   The aptosid software
repository also provides temporary packages to help protect it's users
from some of the issues which can arise from using Debian's unstable
repository. aptosid.com and the associated IRC channels also provide a
means for users of aptosid to provide assistance to one another as well as
to discuss and develop aptosid's own software and tools.

[The MadWifi Project](http://www.madwifi-project.org/) is a team of voluntary developers who
provide Linux drivers for WLAN devices based on Atheros chipsets, namely
MadWifi and ath5k.

MadWifi is one of the most advanced WLAN drivers available for Linux
today. It is stable and has an established userbase. The driver itself
is open source but depends on the proprietary Hardware Abstraction Layer
(HAL) that is available in binary form only.

ath5k is a relatively new and emerging driver and does not depend on the
HAL. It is intended for inclusion into the mainline Linux kernel, exceed
MadWifi feature-wise and replace MadWifi in the long run.

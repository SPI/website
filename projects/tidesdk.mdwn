[TideSDK](http://www.tidesdk.org/) enables the creation of
multi-platform desktop applications with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. It
aims to be the best way to create beautiful, unique desktop apps using
your web development skills.

TideSDK is open source and is committed to incubating the technologies of
tomorrow (that will continue to implement our APIs). A strong community
behind TideSDK results in the best support a developer could wish for.

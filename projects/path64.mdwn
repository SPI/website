# Path64

Many people are not aware of how much compilers play a critical role in
application performance.  By supporting Path64 you can help us make a
large impact on open source and scientific application performance.
Path64 is the open source community version of the high performance
PathScale EKO compiler(tm).  91+% of donations to Path64 will be used
entirely for the needs of the community.  (5% goes to SPI and about 4%
for processing fees) This includes sponsoring direct bug fixes, new
features, academic research, improving documentation, travel budget for
developers and training events. If you'd like your donation to go
directly or solely for any specific Path64 reason please let us know in
the memo field or via email.  Your generosity is greatly appreciated.

Free and Open source projects that are deemed to be genuine, substantial and significant may be eligible for associated project status.

Free and Open source projects interested in becoming SPI associated projects should review these documents:

* [Relationship](http://www.spi-inc.org/projects/relationship/) between SPI and an associated project
* [Services](http://www.spi-inc.org/projects/services/) offered to an associated project

# The Application Process

## Initial Application

If the open source project wants to become an SPI associated project, the first thing needed is to submit an application to any SPI board 
member (preferably one already known to the submitter).

The information needed is:

1. The name and details of the project
2. Which SPI [services](http://www.spi-inc.org/projects/services/) will be needed
3. Who is going to be the liaison to SPI, and the process for selecting/electing replacements

Note: (2) above does not exclude the use of additional SPI services.  This information is sought so that SPI can assess short term service requirements.

After talking to the submitter, the board member will draft an application into a resolution similar to this one if they are personally 
satisfied that the project is suitable for associated project status.

</pre>

## Discussion

This resolution will be presented to the board and the list of SPI contributing members, and discussed. If the project is in some way 
political or controversial, it may be necessary to champion it to the SPI contributing membership. This process is really not as adversarial as it seems - 
the members just want to avoid any difficult-to-rectify mistakes.

After at least three days of discussion, the resolution may be submitted for a vote at an SPI board meeting, which are held monthly on irc.spi-inc.org 
(the OFTC network), channel #spi, according to a schedule published on the SPI web site.  These meetings are public and all are welcome to attend.

## Vote

Board members will judge the application on several merits:

Free Software: is the project a genuine Free Software community project?

Substance: Does the project have an established development community, history of software releases, etc?

Significance: Is the project used by a broad audience, or does it have political or market significance?

## Acceptance

If the resolution passes, the project is invited to become an associated project.  The nominated liaison will be notified of the 
invitation.  They will then have the amount of time stated in the resolution, usually 60 days, to officially accept.

# The Project Liaison

The Liaison is the person from the project to whom the Board listens for all authoritative decisions regarding project assets, fundraising, expenses
and disposition.  While the Board is happy to talk to other members of the project, only the Liaison will be able to send any instructions regarding
funds or assets, unless they delegate someone else.

The SPI Board does not stipulate how the Liaison is chosen in the project, as long as there are clear rules which let the Board know to whom to listen, especially
in the event of disagreement.  For most projects, it is simply one of the project founders who volunteers and appoints their own successor.  A few
projects, such as Debian and PostgreSQL, have well defined election procedures.

It is recommended, but not required, that the Liaison attend Board meetings.  At Board meetings, Liaisons are considered "Advisors", able to bring proposals to the Board 
and speak but not to vote (unless, of course, they also happen to be Board members).

# Participating in SPI

Contributors to the project are eligible for SPI contributing membership subject to the guidelines set out 
[here](http://www.spi-inc.org/membership/guidelines/) but they each have to apply for it individually. The liaison can speed up the membership 
acceptance process by supplying the Board and Membership Committee with a list of eligible contributors for the project. The liaison will be 
consulted where there is doubt.

As the Contributing members elect the Board, as well as argue decisions which the Board feels are controversial enough to merit wide 
discussion, it is important that the project members join SPI to ensure the project is well represented.

# Fundraising

All monetary activities in SPI are administrated by the Treasurer (treasurer@spi-inc.org). 

SPI can accept donations for the project in two ways: checks or credit cards.  Checks must be in American or Canadian dollars and are 
mailed directly to SPI's mailing address.  Credit cards are processed by an external service, Click&amp;Pledge at this time.   The Treasurer 
should be contacted to set up access to credit card donations, which may include the ability to create special donation pages for individual 
campaigns or events for which the project is collecting.

In either case, it is important that the donor designate that the gift is to go to the project.  If a gift arrives without a designated 
project, the Treasurer will attempt to contact the donor, and if unsuccessful will place the money in the SPI general fund.

Please note that as a US 501(c)3 Non-Profit Organization, there are legal restrictions on what money SPI can accept.  Most common project 
fundraising activities are fine, but if the project plans to do anything unusual, please clear it with the treasurer first.  Sales of fixed-price 
items (like T-shirts) are acceptable but the Treasurer needs to know about how the money was collected.

All donations to SPI are charitable under US law, except in certain cases such as t-shirt sales and event tickets.  As a US non-profit, SPI 
ia unable to provide donation tax credits to residents of other countries.

All transaction costs (such as the 4.5% for credit cards, and wire transfer fees) are deducted from the contribution.  5% of the remainder 
is deducted for SPI overhead, primarily accounting, photocopying and postage.  The remaining money is held in trust for the project. 

Due to processing time, it can take between a few days and a few weeks for a donation to arrive in the bank account and be available to the 
project.  Under unusual circumstances an associated project can draw money from the SPI reserves against donations which are confirmed (i.e. check received) 
but not deposited, but this is not normal practice.

The liaison will receive notice of any donations made to the project, with donor details if available.   It is recommended to send 
personalized thank-you e-mails or letters to project donors.

# Paying Project Expenses

The liaison can request payment of project expenses at any time by sending a request to the treasurer.  If the expense is legal, it will be 
paid as soon as the Treasurer can reasonably manage it.  Please note that paying expenses usually means mailing checks, so payment generally 
takes two weeks or more.

Requests for payment should be accompanied by paperwork detailing the expense. If the paperwork is not electronic, it can be faxed or 
posted.  Generally, it is expected that individuals will pay the expenses up front and be reimbursed by SPI, but advance payment can be 
arranged with sufficient advance warning to the treasurer.  The Treasurer also has a credit card for online purchases which for some reason 
need to be made directly by SPI.

There are tax law restrictions on what SPI can legally pay for as a 501(c)3 Non-Profit.  Common expenses like travel, equipment, flyers, 
booths, conference expenses and legal help are generally fine, but some items like software development contracting need to be handled 
carefully.  If the liaison is in doubt they should contact the Treasurer.

Transaction fees from paying expenses (wire transfer fees, cashier's checks and postage) will be paid out of project funds.  Funds may be 
transferred only to other 501(c)3 US non-profit organizations, and may not be transferred to private companies, other types of non-profits, 
or foreign organizations except in compensation.

The Treasurer will give the liaison a monthly report of donations collected and expenses paid for the project.

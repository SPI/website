[YafaRay](http://www.yafaray.org/) is a free open-source raytracing
engine. Raytracing is a rendering technique for generating realistic
images by tracing the path of light through a 3D scene. A render engine
consists of a "faceless" computer program that interacts with a host 3D
application to provide specific raytracing capabilties "on demand".
Blender 3D is the host application of YafaRay.

YafaRay is currently used by a great community of professionals, proud
hobbyists, students and academic institutions. YafaRay is released under
the LGPL 2.1 license.

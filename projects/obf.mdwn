The [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](http://open-bio.org/) (O|B|F) is a non-profit, volunteer-run group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development and Open Science within the biological research community. O|B|F functions as an umbrella organization for its [member projects](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Projects), which include the Bio* projects, some of the most widely used open-source programming toolkits in bioinformatics.

Our main activities include the following:
* Running and supporting the [BOSC conferences](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC).
* Organizing and supporting developer-centric "[Hackathon](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Hackathon)" events.
* [Participating in the Google Summer of Code program](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code) on behalf of our member projects as an umbrella mentoring organization.
* Managing servers, hosting facilities, funds, domain names, and other assets for the benefit of our [member projects](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Projects).

[Synthea](https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/) is an open-source, synthetic patient generator that models the medical history of synthetic patients. Their mission is to provide high-quality, synthetic, realistic but not real, patient data and associated health records covering every aspect of healthcare. The resulting data is free from cost, privacy, and security restrictions, enabling research with Health IT data that is otherwise legally or practically unavailable.

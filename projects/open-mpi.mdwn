The [Open MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) Project is an open source
[Message Passing Interface](http://www.mpi-forum.org/) implementation
that is developed and maintained by a consortium of academic, research,
and industry partners. Open MPI is therefore able to combine the
expertise, technologies, and resources from all across the High
Performance Computing community in order to build the best MPI library
available. Open MPI's plugin-based architecture offers advantages for
system and software vendors, application developers and computer science
researchers.

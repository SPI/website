[FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) is a the leading multimedia framework, able
to decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty
much anything that humans and machines have created. It supports the
most obscure ancient formats up to the cutting edge. No matter if they
were designed by some standards committee, the community or a
corporation. It contains libavcodec, libavutil, libavformat,
libavdevice, libswscale and libswresample which can be used by
applications. As well as ffmpeg, ffserver, ffplay and ffprobe which can
be used by end users for transcoding, streaming and playing.

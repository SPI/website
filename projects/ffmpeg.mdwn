[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) is a leading multimedia framework, able
to decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty
much anything that humans and machines have created. It supports the
most obscure ancient formats up to the cutting edge, no matter if they
were designed by some standards committee, the community, or a
corporation. It contains libavcodec, libavutil, libavformat,
libavdevice, libswscale and libswresample which can be used by
applications, along with ffmpeg, ffserver, ffplay and ffprobe programs 
which can be used directly by end users for transcoding, streaming and playing.

The [Open64](http://www.open64.net/news.html) compiler is an open-source, high
performance compiler suite that targets multiple architectures. It provides a
modern framework to implement advanced optimizations and deliver high
performance.

Open64 is the final result of research contributions from a number of compiler
groups around the world. Formerly known as Pro64, Open64 was initially created
by SGI and licensed under the GNU Public License (GPL v2). It was derived from
SGI's MIPSPro compiler.

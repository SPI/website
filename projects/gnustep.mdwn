[GNUstep](http://www.gnustep.org/) is a cross-platform, object-oriented
framework for desktop application development. Based on the OpenStep
specification originally created by NeXT (now Apple) Inc., GNUstep
enables developers to rapidly build sophisticated software by employing
a large library of reusable software components. GNUstep is used in
production environments at several organizations.

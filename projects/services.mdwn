# Services Offered to Associated Projects

SPI offers a variety of services to associated projects.  The major services offered by SPI are listed here.  Additional services may be 
offered at the discretion of the board.

## Holding Funds

SPI will accept donations and hold funds on behalf of associated projects.  Refunds for legitimate project expenses will be made from funds 
earmarked for an associated project with the consent of the project liaison.  Donations to associated projects by US residents are normally 
tax deductible.  SPI does not assist with fundraising activities.

## Holding Substantial Assets

Substantial equipment, software or other assets which an associated project purchases with SPI funds are owned by SPI.  Currently this applies to 
any purchase over $300.  SPI will also accept donations of assets on behalf of associated projects.  The equipment 
will be used and maintained by the project but SPI will hold legal ownership.

Once held by SPI, assets may only be transferred to another 501(c)3 US non-profit.

## Holding Intangible Assets

Associated projects may transfer intangible assets like trademarks and licenses to SPI for protection.  In addition SPI can seeking to obtain trademarks on behalf of associated projects.

## Signing Contracts

SPI can sign contracts on behalf of associated projects.

Examples include:

* Signing a contract with a venue for an associated project to hold a conference

* Signing a contract for insurance for events held by an associated project

Any costs associated with the contract are borne out of SPI funds earmarked for that associated project.

## Legal Assistance

SPI has access to legal council which the board may consult on behalf of the project, at the board's discretion.

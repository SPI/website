# Services Offered to Associated Projects

SPI offers a variety of services to associated projects.  The major services offered by SPI are listed here.  Additional services may be 
offered at the discretion of the [board](/corporate/board/).

If a project wishes to use one of these services the project liaison should contact the board which will make arrangements as appropriate.

## Accepting Donations and Holding Funds

SPI will accept donations and hold funds on behalf of associated projects.  Reimbursements for legitimate project expenses will be made from
funds earmarked for an associated project with the approval of the project liaison and documentation of the expense.  Donations to
associated projects are typically deductible as a charitable donation for US taxpayers.  SPI does not assist with fundraising activities.

Once held by SPI, funds may only be transferred to another 501(c)3 US non-profit with a compatible purpose. Examples of such non-profits
include the Apache Software Foundation, the Software Freedom Conservancy, and the Free Software Foundation.

There are tax law restrictions on what SPI can legally pay for as a 501(c)3 non-profit.  Common expenses like travel, equipment, flyers,
booths, conference expenses and legal help are generally fine, but some items like software development contracting need to be handled
carefully.  If the liaison is in doubt they should contact the Treasurer.

## Holding Substantial Assets

Substantial equipment, software or other assets valued at over $300 which an associated project purchases with SPI funds are owned by SPI.
SPI will also accept donations of assets on behalf of associated projects.  The equipment will be used and maintained by the project but SPI
will hold legal ownership.

Once held by SPI, substantial assets may only be transferred to another 501(c)3 US non-profit with a compatible purpose. Examples of such
non-profits include the Apache Software Foundation, the Software Freedom Conservancy, and the Free Software Foundation.

## Holding Intangible Assets

Associated projects may transfer intangible assets such as domain names, trademarks and licenses to SPI for protection.  In addition SPI can
seeking to obtain trademarks on behalf of associated projects.

Once held by SPI, intangible assets may only be transferred to another 501(c)3 US non-profit with a compatible purpose. Examples of such
non-profits include the Apache Software Foundation, the Software Freedom Conservancy, and the Free Software Foundation.

## Signing Contracts

SPI can sign contracts on behalf of associated projects.

Examples include:

* Signing a contract with a venue for an associated project to hold a conference

* Signing a contract for insurance for events held by an associated project

Any costs associated with the contract are borne out of SPI funds earmarked for that associated project.

## Legal Assistance

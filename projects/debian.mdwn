# Debian

<center>![Debian](../debian-logo.png)</center>

[Debian GNU/Linux](http://www.debian.org/) is a free operating system (OS) for
your computer. An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities
that make your computer run. Debian uses the [Linux](http://www.linux.com/)
kernel (the core of an operating system), but most of the basic OS tools come
from the [GNU project](http://www.gnu.org/); hence the name GNU/Linux.

The Debian operating system is POSIX based, freely distributable, and
includes features such as true multitasking, virtual memory, shared
libraries, demand loading, proper memory management, TCP/IP networking,
and other features consistent with Unix-type systems. It is used by
individuals and organizations worldwide.

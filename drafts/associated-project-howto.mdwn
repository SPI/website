# Associated Project HOWTO

## Overview of Associated Project Status

SPI offers a variety of services to Associated Projects. These include:

### Funds

SPI will accept donations and hold funds on behalf of the project.  
Refunds for legitimate project expenses will made from funds earmarked 
for the project with the consent of the project liaison.

Donations to associated projects by US residents are normally tax deductible.

SPI does not assist with fundraising activities.

### Substantial Assets

SPI is able to substantial assets (such as servers) on behalf of the 
project.  The equipment will be used and maintained by the project but 
SPI will hold legal ownership.

### Intellectual Property

SPI will hold intellectual property assets such as trademarks on behalf 
of the project.  In addition SPI can seeking to obtain trademarks on 
behalf of the project.

### Contracts

SPI can sign contracts on behalf of the project.  Examples include:

* Signing a contract with a venue for the project to hold a conference

* Signing a contract for insurance for events

Any costs associated with the contract are borne out of SPI funds 
earmarked for the project.

### Governance

SPI does not own, govern or control a project.  All actions by SPI on 
behalf of associated projects must comply with relevant laws, SPI's 
By-Laws and 501(c)3 status.

## The Application Process

If your open source project wants to become an associated project of SPI, the
first thing you need to do is to submit an application to any SPI board member
(preferably one you already know).  The information you need to provide is:

1. The name of your project, and some details about it if we wouldn't have
   heard of it before.
2. Which SPI services you will need.
3. Who is going to be your liaison to SPI, and what your process for
   selecting/electing liaisons is.

After talking to you, the board member will draft your application into 
a resolution similar to this one if they are personally satisfied that 
the project is suitable for associated project status.

<pre>
SPI resolution 2006-09-19.mcs.2

WHEREAS

1. Gallery is a substantial and significant Free Software project.

2. The Gallery developers would like SPI's support and assistance, including
   taking donations.

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

3. Gallery is formally invited to become an SPI Associated Project, according
   to the SPI Framework for Associated Projects, SPI Resolution
   1998-11-16.iwj.1-amended-2004-08-10.iwj.1, a copy of which can be found at
   http://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/resolutions/2004/2004-08-10.iwj.1/

4. Currently, Bharat Mediratta is recognised by SPI as the current
   authoritative decision maker and SPI liaison for Gallery.  Successors will
   be appointed in turn by the sitting project liaison.

5. This invitation will lapse, if not accepted, 60 days after it is approved by
   the SPI Board.
</pre>

This resolution will be presented to the board and the list of SPI contributing
members, and discussed.  If your project is in some way political or
controversial, you may be called on to champion it to the SPI membership.  This
process is really not as adversarial as it seems; since we have never dismissed
an associated project, the members just want to avoid any difficult-to-rectify
mistakes.

After at least three days for discussion, the resolution will then go to the
next SPI Board Meeting, which are held monthly on irc.spi-inc.org (the OFTC
network), channel #spi, according to a schedule published on the SPI web site. 
You are welcome and encouraged to attend.

Board members will judge the application on several merits:

Free Software: is the project a genuine Free Software community project?

Substance: Does it have an established development community, history of
software releases, etc?

Significance: Is the project used by a broad audience, or does it have
political or market significance?

If the resolution passes, your project will be accepted and you will be
notified of the invitation.  You then have the amount of time stated in the
resolution, usually 60 days, to officially accept.

## Your Project Liaison

The Liaison is the person from your project to whom the Board listens for all
authoritative decisions regarding your project assets, fundraising, expenses
and disposition.  While the Board is happy to talk to other members of your
project, only the Liaison will be able to send any instructions regarding your
funds or assets, unless they delegate someone else.

The SPI Board does not care how the Liaison is chosen in your project, as long
as there are clear rules which let the Board know to whom to listen, especially
in the event of disagreement.  For most projects, it is simply one of the
project founders who volunteers and appoints his own successor.  A few
projects, such as Debian and PostgreSQL, have well defined election procedures.

It is recommended, but not required, that your Liason attend Board meetings,
and subscribe to the board@spi-inc.org mailing list.  He or she will be
subscribed to the liasons@spi-inc.org list.  At Board meetings, Liaisons are
considered "Advisors", able to bring proposals to the Board and speak but not
to vote (unless, of course, they also happen to be Board members).

## Participating in SPI Politically

All major contributors to your project are eligible for SPI contributing
membership, but they each have to apply for it individually:
[http://www.spi-inc.org/membership/](http://www.spi-inc.org/membership/). You
can speed the membership acceptance process up by supplying the Board and
Membership Committee with a list of eligible contributors for your project.
You will be consulted where there is doubt.

As the Contributing members elect the Board, as well as argue decisions which
the Board feels are controversial enough to merit wide discussion, it is
important that your project members join SPI to ensure your project is well
represented.

## Fundraising

All monetary activities in SPI are administrated by the Treasurer
(treasurer@spi-inc.org). 

SPI can accept donations for your project one of two ways: checks or credit
cards.  Checks must be in American or Canadian dollars and are mailed directly
to SPI's mailing address.  Credit cards are processed by an external service,
Click&amp;Pledge at this time.   Contact the Treasurer to set up your access to
credit card donations, which may include the ability to create special donation
pages for individual campaigns or events for which your project is collecting.

In either case, it is important that the donor designate that the gift is to go
to your organization.  If a gift arrives without a designated project, the
Treasurer will attempt to contact the donor, and if unsuccessful will place the
money in the SPI general fund.

Please note that as a US 501(c)3 Non-Profit Organization, there are legal
restrictions on what money SPI can accept.  Most common project fundraising
activities are fine, but if you plan to do anything unusual, please clear it
with the treasurer first.  Sales of fixed-price items (like T-shirts) are
acceptable but the Treasurer needs to know about how the money was collected.

All donations to SPI are charitable under US law, except for things like
t-shirt sales and event tickets.  As a US non-profit, we are unable to provide
donation tax credits to citizens of other countries.

All transaction costs (such as the 4.5% for credit cards, and wire transfer
fees) are deducted from the contribution.  5% of the remainder is deducted for
SPI overhead, primarily accounting, photocopying and postage.  The remaining
money is held in trust for your project. 

Please do note that due to processing time, it can take between a few days and
a few weeks for a donation to hit the bank account and be available for your
project to spend.  Under unusual circumstances you can draw money from the SPI
reserves against donations which are confirmed (i.e. check received) but not
deposited, but this is not normal practice.

You will receive notice of any donations made to your project, with donor
details if available.   It is good practice to send personalized thank-you
e-mails or letters to your donors.

There is no expectation that SPI be your exclusive fundraising vehicle.

## Paying Project Expenses

Your Liaison can request payment of project expenses at any time by sending a
request to the treasurer.  If the expense is legal, it will be paid as soon as
the Treasurer can reasonably manage it.  Please note that paying expenses
usually means mailing checks, so payment generally takes two weeks or more.

Requests for payment should be accompanied by paperwork detailing the expense. 
If the paperwork is not electronic, you can fax or mail it.  Generally, it is
expected that individuals will pay the expenses up front and be reimbursed by
SPI, but advance payment can be arranged with sufficient advance warning to the
treasurer.  The Treasurer also has a credit card for online purchases which for
some reason need to be made directly by SPI.

There are tax law restrictions on what we can legally pay for as a 501(c)3
Non-Profit.  Common expenses like travel, equipment, flyers, booths, conference
expenses and legal help are generally fine, but some things like software
development contracting need to be handled carefully.  When in doubt, contact
the Treasurer.

Transaction fees from paying expenses (wire transfer fees, cashier's checks and
postage) will be paid out of your project funds.  Money may be transferred only
to other 501(c)3 US non-profit organizations, and may not be transferred to
private companies, other types of non-profits, or foreign organizations except
in compensation.

The Treasurer will give you a monthly report of donations collected and
expenses paid for your project.  In the future, there will be an online
reporting interface which will allow you to check balances at any time.

## Assets

Substantial equipment, software or other assets which you buy with SPI money
becomes an asset of SPI (the current threshold is $300, but this may be
raised).  Further, you may transfer other assets you own, especially intangible
assets like trademarks and licenses, to SPI for protection.  SPI will also
accept donations of assets on your behalf.

Ownership status does not affect the physical location of the asset; your
server may be held by SPI but be racked in Borneo and administered entirely by
your project.

Once held by SPI, assets may only be transferred to another 501(c)3 US
non-profit.

## Legal Assistance

TBA

## Leaving SPI

Your Liaison may decide that your project is quitting SPI at any time.  Any
assets and money held by SPI for your project may be transferred to the 501(c)3
US non-profit of your choice, or simply held until expended.

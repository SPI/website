# Relationship Between SPI and Partners

SPI has relationships with other organisations that provide support Free 
and Open Source Software.  This page explains the relationship between 
these organisations and SPI.

## Förderung Freier Informationen und Software e.V (FFIS)

SPI can request [FFIS](http://www.ffis.de/) association on behalf of an 
SPI associated project.  If a project wishes to do this the project 
liaison should contact the SPI board.  An SPI board member will contact 
FFIS on behalf of the project and make the application.

Acceptance of a project by FFIS is not automatic for SPI associated 
projects.  However, since the acceptance criteria are similar for each 
organisation, SPI associated projects generally fulfill the criteria for 
acceptance by FFIS.

FFIS is able to hold funds and provide other services in Europe for its 
associated projects.

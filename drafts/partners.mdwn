# Relationship Between SPI and Partners

SPI has relationships with other organisations that provide support Free and Open Source Software.  This page explains the relationship between these organisations and SPI.

## Förderung Freier Informationen und Software e.V (FFIS)

When requested by the project liaison SPI can approach FFIS and request 
FFIS association on behalf of the project.

Acceptance of a project by FFIS is not automatic for SPI associated 
projects.

Since the acceptance criteria are similar for each organisation, SPI 
associated projects generally fulfill the criteria for acceptance by 
FFIS.

FFIS is able to hold funds in Europe for its associated projects.

## Associazione per il Software Libero

# Board Meetings

SPI holds its board meetings publicly on IRC using the #spi channel on
irc.spi-inc.org (part of the [OFTC](http://www.oftc.net/) network). The
by-laws state that this must happen at least quarterly, but we aim for a
monthly meeting at 20:30 UTC on the third Wednesday of the month.

Items to be discussed at a meeting need to be put on the agenda prior to
the meeting. Please contact the SPI Secretary to get your item on the agenda.
Contact information for the Secretary is available from the
[Board](../corporate/board/) page.

Resolutions adopted by the Board are posted to the
[spi-announce](http://lists.spi-inc.org/cgi-bin/listinfo/spi-announce)
mailing list and posted to the [resolutions](../corporate/resolutions/)
page. After Board approval, minutes from SPI meetings can be found on the
[minutes](minutes/) with raw [logs](logs/) also available.

The agenda for the next board meeting can be found in the [agenda](agendas/)
section. We also have a publicly viewable Google Calendar
[ics](https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/d15uhtjihbkq1rf4fc4gf3kgjo%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) file.

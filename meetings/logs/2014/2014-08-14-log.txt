[20:12:34]< Ganneff> Anything? Agenda is empty
[20:13:18]< Ganneff> sounds like nothing, short meeting we will get...
[20:13:20]< tbm> Officer election should be on the agenda since this is the first meeting after the election.
[20:13:20]< Ganneff> [item 8, Appointment of board officers]
[20:13:20]< Ganneff> Oh cool, with two of em absent.
[20:13:35]< tbm> ah, never mind :)
[20:13:40]< zobel> ah, nicklist would had been comma-separeted.
[20:13:53]< Solver> can we call bdale?
[20:14:06]< Ganneff> so, we should elect officers... two current ones are not near here.
[20:14:26]< zobel> Ganneff: Noodles said he will not run again, IIRC
[20:14:31]< Ganneff> yes
[20:14:33]< Ganneff> on list
[20:14:39]< Ganneff> so we need at least a new secretary
[20:14:52] * zobel looks at tbm....
[20:14:56]< Solver> bdale's phone number is in the board-private repo
[20:14:56]< Ganneff> did bdale say anything?
[20:15:52]< Ganneff> and, do we have anyone who would like to take one of the positions?
[20:16:12] * schultmc is willing to serve as treasurer again
[20:16:30] * Ganneff can do VP again, unless you say I shouldnt.
[20:16:53] * linuxhiker is willing to help anyway the board sees fit (especially now that his life is back in order)
[20:17:01]< Solver> could someone in the US pls give bdale a call...
[20:17:11]< linuxhiker> Solver: if you pm me his number, I will
[20:17:13]< Ganneff> we need a new secretary (write minutes, agendas, send reminders about meetings, deal with questions around spi that secretary gets a bit more than others)
[20:17:37]< zobel> i just texted broonie 
[20:17:37]< Solver> linuxhiker: done
[20:17:42]< zobel> i just texted bdale 
[20:17:47]< linuxhiker> calling
[20:17:50]< Solver> ta
[20:17:58]< bdale> oops
[20:18:09]< bdale> Bdale Garbee
[20:18:12]< Ganneff> aha!
[20:18:14]< zobel> hi bdale 
[20:18:18]< linuxhiker> bdale I just hung up on you
[20:18:26]< Ganneff> bdale: officer election time. are you running away or want to keep president? :)
[20:18:27]< bdale> linuxhiker: thanks for letting me know that was you
[20:18:46]< zobel> bdale: you should have an SMS from my companies cell phone...
[20:18:49]< bdale> I'm willing to continue as president.
[20:18:58] * linuxhiker notes that he could be treasurer or president, but secretary requires a different skillset than he offers
[20:18:59]< Ganneff> so we have 3 possibly continues
[20:18:59]< bdale> zobel: I do, that's what caused me to appear .. thanks!
[20:19:03]< Ganneff> noone yet for secretary
[20:19:06]< zobel> good. so we only need a new secretary.
[20:19:22]< Solver> glp: we kee out of band contact details for the board...  I'll point you at it later
[20:19:35]< schultmc> tbm had sort of expressed interest about secretary on list
[20:19:44]< tbm> I can act as secretary if there are no other volunteers.  I have some questions about record keeping but we can discuss that later.
[20:19:50] * Solver would happily nominate tbm
[20:19:56]< glp> me to
[20:19:56] * linuxhiker seconded
[20:20:13]< Ganneff> ok, anyone want to compete with us other 3 existing ones?
[20:20:14]< zobel> i could run as well, but past told us that this is not a good idea.
[20:20:24] * Solver is not running for a position as officer
[20:20:34]< zobel> but if tbm wants to run, then i will not run
[20:20:37]< Ganneff> or do we have a set of 4 to vote on to confirm?
[20:21:13]< Solver> seems like we do
[20:21:48]< Ganneff> i see no one else speaking up, so lets confirm bdale == president, me == vice president, tbm == secretary, schultmc == treasurer for another round?
[20:21:58]< schultmc> !vote yes
[20:22:02]< linuxhiker> !vote yes
[20:22:03]< glp> !vote yes
[20:22:05]< zobel> !vote yes

21:02 < Ganneff> one for tbm
21:02 < zobel> linuxhiker: ECHAN?
21:02 < tbm> The web site and by-laws have been updated to reflect the current directors and officers.
21:02 < tbm> zobel kindly prepared the minutes for the August 14 meeting.
21:02 < tbm> I've received no resolutions for consideration.
21:02 < tbm> I found a small inaccuracy in the July minutes at http://spi-inc.org/meetings/minutes/2014/2014-07-10/
21:02 < tbm> In Appendix A: Current Board Membership, "Last elected" lists "July 2010" for several directors instead of "July 2013".
21:02 < tbm> Does anyone object to me fixing this without a vote to re-approve the minutes?
21:02 < Noodles> The election was after that meeting.
21:03 < zobel> tbm: yes, i found that too.
21:03 < Noodles> Oh, 2013, not 2014.
21:03 < Noodles> Go for it.
21:03 < tbm> ok, will do
21:03 < tbm> nothing else from me
21:03 < Ganneff> [item 6, Outstanding minutes]

21:05 < Ganneff> [item 7, Items up for discussion]
21:05 < Ganneff> Agenda says there is nothing
21:05 < Ganneff> [item 8, AOB]
21:05 < Ganneff> Anyone anything? You have -5 seconds to speak up or be silent forever. :)
21:05 < Solver> yes one item
21:05 < Ganneff> arrr. go
21:05 < Solver> just the question I posed on list
21:05  * zobel has one itme too.
21:05 < Noodles> I did some fixing up of the members website back at the start of August such that what we have in git matches what we're actually running; would have mentioned it last month but I wasn't present.
21:05 < Solver> can I proceed with joining SPI to the organisation I mentiond on list?
21:06 < Solver> NPCCNY
21:06 < Noodles> What does operating budget mean?
21:06 < Ganneff> shouldnt that have a vote?
21:06 < Noodles> Is ours effectively the PO BOX / the bookkeeper?
21:07 < Noodles> (i.e. what annual dues are we committing to here)
21:07 < glp> Solver I suggested that it would be good to attend some meetings before making the decision?
21:07 < tbm> glp: I believe you're only allowed to attend if you're a member.
21:07 < Noodles> In general I'm in favour but I'd want to know what the costs actually are and I think it needs a resolution.
21:08 < linuxhiker> Noodles: do our bylaws state that operational decisions need a resolution?
21:09 < Noodles> It's not an operational decision. It's a decision to join another organisation.
21:09 < glp> tbm: sounds odd if they don't have some kind of 'introduction-deal'
21:10 < Noodles> Can we just check how much it costs? If it falls under the $35/year category then I don't see why we shouldn't do it. I had done a little investigation into D&O insurance and found them myself at one point.
21:10 < Ganneff> ok, so need a resolution (Solver: going to prepare one for next meeting?) and probably some more data
21:10 < Solver> ok
21:10 < Ganneff> zobel: now you
21:11 < zobel> we have one project request to join spi
21:11 < zobel> sonargnulinux.com
21:11 < zobel> i didn't find much data on the internet about their structure, it seems to me a 1 man show
21:11 < Noodles> Did you get extra info from them? I didn't see any followup to your mail.
21:11 < zobel> if anyone has more input on that would help
21:12 < zobel> nope.
21:12 < Ganneff> so thats something for them to clear up before it goes on and gets to vote on
21:12 < Ganneff> right, anyone else?
21:12 < zobel> </done>
21:12 < Noodles> There are multiple committers to their gitorious repo.
21:12 < Noodles> But wait for them to provide the info IMO.
21:12 < Ganneff> [item 10, Next board meeting]
21:12 < Ganneff> Next board meeting: October 9th, 2014, 20:00 UTC
21:12 < Ganneff> I may be able to make it, but not sure, so:
21:12 < Ganneff> tbm: Tentative regrets from my side, maybe I'm away watching the second kid crawl out...
21:13 < linuxhiker> o.k. as a side note, it appears that I don't receive any spi emails anymore (and I have no idea why)
21:13 < linuxhiker> oh sorry
21:13 < linuxhiker> I am good with that meeting time
21:13 < Solver> They have a support mailing list which I just joined so I can see how busy it is
21:13 < Ganneff> linuxhiker: out of meeting we can look
21:13 -!- Ganneff changed the topic of #spi to: http://www.spi-inc.org/ | Next board meeting October 9th, 2014, 20:00 UTC (aka `date -d @@1412884800` or `date -r @1412884800`)
21:13 < zobel> tbm: i might be on VAC during next meeting.
21:13 < Ganneff> *GAVEL*

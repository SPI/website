20:08 #spi: < Noodles> Sent.
20:10 #spi:  * Noodles updates his contact details to reflect the change of continent.
20:10 #spi: < Ganneff> minor details
20:10 #spi: < Solver> :)
20:10 #spi: < Noodles> Well, also I checked the tree out for future reference.
20:11 #spi: < bkuhn> While you all wait for your quorum could I raise an inquiry that probably doesn't require quorum to give me some more info on? 
20:12 #spi: < Solver> Sure...
20:12 #spi: < Ganneff> sure, but i think wait is over soon.
20:12 #spi: < bkuhn> So, Conservancy has been wondering if SPI will present us with a new proposed grant agreement.
20:12 #spi: < bkuhn> but, if you get your quorum, this surely goes under new business for you. :)
20:13 #spi: < Ganneff> yeah, otherwise i stop this at :15.
20:13 #spi: < Ganneff> and, err, i have no idea about your question
20:13 #spi: < Noodles> I'm not sure what the hold up was on the agreement.
20:14 #spi: < Solver> SFC sent an email
20:14 #spi: < bkuhn> Noodles: from our perspective: Bdale and Jimmy had approved some wording on May 11, 2013.  SPI tossed it to its legal counsel, your legal counsel talked to your legal counsel.  Your legal counsel said it was "back in the hands of [her] client"
20:14 #spi: < bkuhn> Anyway, as Solver mentions, details of status was in an email dated Fri, 07 Feb 2014 12:26:22 -0500 from Conservancy's Tony Sebro, message-id:  <52F5173E.8030106@sfconservancy.org>
20:15 #spi: < Ganneff> and as it doesnt look like we get more people...
20:15 #spi: < Ganneff> *GAVEL*

13:00 #spi: < Hydroxide> Noodles: not trying to spring it on you. I didn't have a chance to look before now. I doubt anyone will object if you change it silently when you get a chance.
13:00 #spi: < bdale> wrong date in the url, too
13:00 #spi: < Ganneff> old template he uses
13:00 #spi: < Noodles> Hydroxide: I've fixed it.

13:02 #spi: < bdale> [item 3, President's Report]

13:03 #spi: < schultmc> Treasurer's reports for January and February are in the agenda
13:03 #spi: < schultmc> I'm working on catching up on the remaining backlog
13:03 #spi: < bdale> great
13:03 #spi: < Solver> how is it going with the bookkeepers?
13:03 #spi: < schultmc> I also wanted to publicly thank the Craigslist Foundation for their unsolicted donations of $25,000 to SPI and $25,000 to PostgreSQL
13:03 #spi: < bdale> any status update on working with the book keeper, etc?
13:03 #spi: < Hydroxide> schultmc: that's very impressive. Thanks to them!
13:03 #spi: < schultmc> I reached out to the bookkeeper (both the individual bookkeeper and the COO of the company)
13:03 #spi: < bdale> indeed!
13:04 #spi: < Ganneff> oh gosh i know what happened with that silly buggers mail. it came through all fine, it was a manual deletion. bet i took it as spam by subject. :(
13:04 #spi: < zobel> i did some cross checking on the latest pdf book entries schultmc did commit to board-private, looks good so far.
13:04 #spi: < schultmc> they apologiesed for the delay in timely reports and want to make sure I have all the access I need and they're planning a phone or in person meeting to get the bookkeeper up to speed on anything outstanding
13:04 #spi: < schultmc> future reports from them should be available by the 10th of a given month
13:05 #spi: < Solver> great
13:05 #spi: < bdale> ok, sounds like progress
13:05 #spi: < bdale> please let us know how the meeting goes when it happens, and if any of the rest of us can/should help, just ask
13:05 #spi: < schultmc> will do
13:05 #spi: < bdale> anything else?
13:05 #spi: < zobel> schultmc: can you commit the xtrade pdfs too?
13:05 #spi: < schultmc> no, other than I have a work conferency call at 16:30 EDT thus have a hard stop in ~25 mins
13:05 #spi: < Hydroxide> thanks for that progress.
13:05 #spi: < schultmc> zobel: yes
13:06 #spi: < bdale> [item 5, Secretary's report]
13:06 #spi: < bdale> Jonathan?
13:06 #spi: < Noodles> I've finished moving all of the old votes and meeting agendas etc into the new website (so back to 2004).
13:06 #spi: < bdale> yay!
13:06 #spi: < Ganneff> yay
13:06 #spi: < bdale> what's left, then?
13:07 #spi: < Noodles> I ended up moving a few other bits as part of that and I don't think there's very much at all left from the old site that isn't moved across.
13:07 #spi: < Noodles> I have details but not locally (on my laptop at home).
13:07 #spi: < bdale> ok
13:07 #spi: < Ganneff> when we are at website details: not all of board have git access yet
13:07 #spi: < bdale> ping me later if there's anything you'd like my help reviewing, it'd be glad to close that chapter of history 
13:07 #spi: < Ganneff> those who dont and want, i need ssh keys from em.
13:07 #spi: < Ganneff> (thats also for board and board private repo)
13:08 #spi: < bdale> so noted
13:08 #spi: < bdale> anything else?
13:08 #spi: < Noodles> Nothing else from me.

13:10 #spi: < bdale> [item 7.1, Resolution 2014-05-06.jrk.1: Martin Michlmayr as interim director
13:10 #spi: < bdale> I saw Gregers note of concern and replied on -private, any other discussion?
13:11 #spi: < Solver> we have an outstanding project application.  we need to decide what we are going to do with this
13:11 #spi: < zobel> i would like to express that i read his mail and understand it.
13:11 #spi: < zobel> the concerns he has.
13:11 #spi: < Solver> the hold up being questions about resolution wording.
13:11 #spi: < bdale> Solver: please hold that for item 8
13:11 #spi: < Solver> ok will do
13:11 #spi: < zobel> Solver: read backlog: i will sponsor it.
13:12 #spi: < bdale> rephrasing, any other discussion about appointing tbm to fill the interim position before we vote on the resolution?
13:12 #spi: < Hydroxide> glp: I agree it would have been ideal if a more proactive selection process had occurred. as you noted, this is only for a few months and then the election will be as public as this should have been
13:12 #spi: < Noodles> zobel: He means Chakra I think.
13:12 #spi: < zobel> ah.
13:13 #spi: < Hydroxide> only other comments from me: 1) I'll abstain to leave the official decision to the other directors, but I do support tbm's appointment; and 2) It's been a pleasure serving on the board and as Treasurer and Secretary over the last 10 years, and on the bylaws committee before that. I look forward to SPI's future.
13:13 #spi: < bdale> Hydroxide: thank you VERY much
13:13 #spi: < Solver> Hydroxide: you'll be missed on the board
13:13 #spi: < Hydroxide> glp: and I would welcome your candidacy in this summer's elections. more new blood is needed.
13:13 #spi: < bdale> Noodles: I think we can vote now ..
13:13 #spi: < zobel> i would like to encourage glp to run during next elections.

13:15 #spi: < zobel> tbm: welcome.
13:15 #spi: < bdale> tbm: congrats, and welcome
13:15 #spi: < tbm> thanks, I look forward to working with you!
13:15 #spi: < Hydroxide> yes, congrats, thanks, nd welcome
13:15 #spi: < Noodles> I should point out I have absolutely no issues with tbm's ability and suitability for SPI.
13:15 #spi: < bdale> Ganneff: please add tbm to the board list, and I guess it's time to drop Hydroxide
13:15 #spi: < Solver> tbm: welcome to the board.  I look forward working with you on some of the outstanding tasks we have
13:15 #spi: < Ganneff> bdale: willdo.
13:16 #spi: < Ganneff> tbm: an ssh key would be nice for access to git
13:16 #spi: < Ganneff> tbm: and preferred mail address?
13:16 #spi: < bdale> [item 8, Any other business]
13:16 #spi: < bdale> Do any board members have other items for discussion they would like to address briefly?
13:16 #spi: < tbm> Ganneff: tbm@cyrius.com
13:16 #spi: < tbm> Ganneff: I'll email you my key
13:16 #spi: < tbm> Ganneff: tbm@
13:16 #spi: < Solver> bdale: 2 items technically although they are linked
13:16 #spi: < bdale> Solver: go
13:17 #spi: < Ganneff> tbm: fine.
13:17 #spi: < Solver> (1) Chakra resolutiuon (2) what we are going to do about concerns over wording of resolution template
13:17 #spi: < Noodles> I had thought post the last meeting you would take the existing resolution and tidy it up based on the feedback and we'd be ready to vote on it today.
13:17 #spi: < Solver> Chakra has been waiting for us to proceed on a vote.  I'm concerned they are waiting on what is effectively a structural matter about how we word the resolutions
13:17 #spi: < bdale> for 2, I think we should just plan to pass the next few resolution drafts by counsel until we hit the happy balancing point
13:18 #spi: < bdale> I was not aware that we were holding anyone back due to 2
13:18 #spi: < bdale> I'm working with another project that I hope we'll have a draft resolution for in a week or two that I will pass by counsel for review
13:19 #spi: < Noodles> I didn't put the resolution on the meeting last month because there was active discussion still going on.
13:19 #spi: < Solver> Noodles: I left it for further discussion.  ok so if I repost we can perhaps do an email vote.
13:19 #spi: < Noodles> I didn't receive a modified (or unmodified) copy to put on for this month.
13:19 #spi: < Solver> ok I'll update and send
13:19 #spi: < bdale> yeah, ok, so we dropped the ball
13:19 #spi: < Solver> which brings us to (2)
13:20 #spi: < bdale> under the circumstances, if you want to try an email vote that's ok, just remember that our bylaws require those be unanimous, I think?
13:20 #spi: < Hydroxide> I'm fine approving the most recent draft this meeting, but if the board prefers to wait, I encourage the board to pass it by email vote instead of waiting a whole month.
13:20 #spi: < Noodles> bdale: Yes, unanimous for an email vote.
13:20 #spi: < Solver> I had not planned any changes
13:20 #spi: < Hydroxide> bdale: s/bylaws/governing law/
13:20 #spi: < bdale> Hydroxide: thanks
13:20 #spi: < bdale> which is ridiculous, but not something we can fix today
13:21 #spi: < bdale> I don't think we should try to vote Chakra in-meeting today, as I for one am not up to speed on the current draft
13:21 #spi: < bdale> and I know schultmc said he needs to leave shortly
13:21 #spi: < Solver> that's fine. we can do an email vote soon
13:21 #spi: < bdale> ok, that works for me
13:22 #spi: < Hydroxide> ok
13:22 #spi: < Solver> bdale: let's review your upcoming resolution then and see if it can be the basis of a new template
13:23 #spi: < bdale> with respect to 2, the request that we do a better job of describing each project's connection to SPI's mission and purpose is "soft", in the sense that it's not like we have a hard procedural/structural change we need to make in the template
13:23 #spi: < bdale> that's why I think some iteration may be required to get one or two that "feel right" and can be examples (more that than templates) for future use
13:24 #spi: < Noodles> We also need to reword the decision maker piece.
13:24 #spi: < bdale> right
13:24 #spi: < Hydroxide> I definitely don't think we should delay Chakra until we have perfection in our template
13:24 #spi: < bdale> agree
13:24 #spi: < Solver> agreed
13:24 #spi: < Solver> ok I'm satisfied on my items
13:24 #spi: < bdale> the one I'm working on has SFLC actively engaged anyway, so it's an easy one to use as a test case for this
13:24 #spi: < bdale> anything else?
13:25 #spi: < bdale> [item 9, Next board meeting]
13:25 #spi: < bdale> Our next regularly-scheduled monthly meeting would be 12 June 2014, 20:00 UTC.
13:25 #spi: < bdale> Any strong objections?
13:25 #spi:  * zobel on VAC
13:25 #spi: < Noodles> Fine by me. I'll be back in BST by that point.
13:25 #spi: < Ganneff> should work
13:26 #spi: < Solver> Fine for me
13:26 #spi: < bdale> ok
13:26 #spi: < bdale> Ok, thank you to everyone present for participating today.

20:08 < zv> sorry, i am having network problems. i will reply about secretary report and regrets in a moment
20:09 < schultmc> [item 7, Items up for discussion]
20:09 < schultmc> Nothing on the agenda
20:09 < schultmc> [item 8, Any other business]
20:09 < schultmc> Anything to discuss?
20:09 < fsf> OmegaT is looking for a fiscal host and reached out; I sent along a message asking them to submit their application to board@, but haven't seen anything. Did I miss their response? I just want to make sure it doesn't get lost.
20:10  * schultmc hasn't seen anything from them
20:10 < zv> secretary report will need to wait. i cannot access my home computer.
20:10 < zv> and i can't access our email because google has locked me out for using a data center ip
20:10 < zv> jonatas is a regret and one other.
20:11 < fsf> OK, cool. They'd initially applied years ago and I guess never heard anything (unsure if our mistake or they sent to the wrong address or similar). No action necessary if we're still waiting of course; I'm happy to be their sponsor if/when they send along the application
20:11 < fungi> zv: jconway: had expresed a tentative regret, but seems to be present
20:12 < zv> thanks.
20:12 < jconway> fingers crossed my connection continues to work from the car ;-)

2025-11-10 20:22:50	schultmc	[item 7.1, Annual contractor renewal reminder for 2026]
2025-11-10 20:23:42	fungi	Jesusalva[m] reached out to add this to the agenda, basically no vote required but reminding directors that we renew contracts for our contractors annually and that's about to happen for 2026 so now is the time to raise concerns or questions
2025-11-10 20:25:08	Jesusalva[m]	Yes
2025-11-10 20:25:25	Jesusalva[m]	We usually adjust the rates based on inflation+some real increase
2025-11-10 20:26:22	-->	borden (~borden@99.209.53.2) has joined #spi
2025-11-10 20:26:22	Jesusalva[m]	This raises SPI costs yearly, and market doesn't always raise in the same pace as inflation
2025-11-10 20:26:54	Jesusalva[m]	The Board is responsible to ensure no staff is overpaid or underpaid, so if anyone has concerns it's the time to raise them
2025-11-10 20:27:28	Jesusalva[m]	(Or if Treasurer Team thinks SPI donations increased less than inflation)
2025-11-10 20:28:06	borden	Borden here. Sorry I'm late. Forgot the time change, even though the meeting notice very clearly warned me about it
2025-11-10 20:28:45	fungi	borden: please state your full name for the minutes
2025-11-10 20:28:54	borden	sorry, Borden Rhodes present
2025-11-10 20:29:00	fungi	i'll record you as partially present

2025-11-10 20:29:31	schultmc	[item 7.2, Indemnity for Debian package reviewers (DFSG Team)]
2025-11-10 20:29:37	fungi	the debian project leader, andreas, contacted me about this following some discussion of reorganizing debian's long-standing "ftp masters" delegation. the community volunteers who review software proposed for inclusion in their distribution are concerned with the legal ramifications of accidentally making a mistake
2025-11-10 20:29:42	fungi	they're asking if it's possible and reasonable to obtain something along the lines of our "director and officer indemnity" insurance for those delegates in case they end up named in any intellectual property lawsuit as a result of their well-intended decisions
2025-11-10 20:30:28	fungi	i don't really know whether that's appropriate nor how it's usually handled, not even whether insurance is the most appropriate legal vehicle for such things, but said i'd ask the rest of the board
2025-11-10 20:31:28	schultmc	I wonder if reaching out to counsel would be appropriate. I'm not certain if there's insurance that would cover this but they might be more knowledgeable.
2025-11-10 20:31:33	borden	So the problem we're trying to solve is whether we'll cover Debian if they accidentally include software in their distro that violates a licence?
2025-11-10 20:31:37	fungi	i'm not calling for a vote on this for now, but wanted to bring it to everyone's attention and hopefully get some preliminary answers for the debian leadership
2025-11-10 20:32:09	jconway	seems worthwhile to ask for legal advice
2025-11-10 20:32:19	mappx	+1
2025-11-10 20:32:28	Jesusalva[m]	+1
2025-11-10 20:32:29	fungi	and yes, my initial suggestion in that conversation was that we could ask counsel about the risks on debian's behalf, but subsequent private conversations to which i was not a party morphed into a request for d&o indemnity
2025-11-10 20:32:31	milan	+1
2025-11-10 20:32:59	fungi	thanks. i'll try to formulate a question to our counsel about this
2025-11-10 20:33:09	milan	+1 for getting legal advice
2025-11-10 20:33:11	fungi	that's all i had on this topic unless there are followup comments
2025-11-10 20:34:09	schultmc	[item 8, Any other business]
2025-11-10 20:34:10	schultmc	Anything to discuss?
2025-11-10 20:34:47	Jesusalva[m]	Yes
2025-11-10 20:34:50	-->	borden_ (~borden@2607:f2c0:e385:ffe2:6401:34aa:1dd0:61b1) has joined #spi
2025-11-10 20:35:18	Jesusalva[m]	As we talked about earlier, Zumbi wants to set an eventual payment clerk remuneration in 45 usd/hr with a 10 hours cap
2025-11-10 20:35:34	fungi	i have no objection
2025-11-10 20:35:42	mappx	no objection here
2025-11-10 20:35:44	jconway	wfm
2025-11-10 20:35:48	milan	wfm
2025-11-10 20:35:50	schultmc	sounds reasonable
2025-11-10 20:35:50	fungi	sounds like a reasonable rate and time scope
2025-11-10 20:35:57	Jesusalva[m]	Assuming board has no objections, he also wants to know best way to handle this selection - public postings or private appointment
2025-11-10 20:36:17	fungi	we usually at least make an attempt at a public posting right?
2025-11-10 20:36:19	Jesusalva[m]	Previous selections were announced somewhat haphazardly
2025-11-10 20:36:57	Jesusalva[m]	fungi yes, although he was hoping for something a bit more directive (eg post to X ml and then select or send mail to board select)
2025-11-10 20:37:37	fungi	i feel like it can be brief so as not to unnecessarily delay the work, but if someone's following these discussions and wants to be considered i wouldn't want to deprive them of the opportunity
2025-11-10 20:38:09	borden_	Do we have a job description and qualifications?
2025-11-10 20:39:07	Jesusalva[m]	https://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/resolutions/2025/2025-10-13.jln.1/
2025-11-10 20:39:39	fungi	a few days/one week from announcement to accepting a candidate maybe?
2025-11-10 20:39:58	Jesusalva[m]	"The position is ideal for individuals with strong organizational skills and experience in administrative or financial processing, helping to streamline our payment operations efficiently"
2025-11-10 20:40:05	Jesusalva[m]	fungi: Feels adequate imo
2025-11-10 20:40:10	Jesusalva[m]	But posting to where?
2025-11-10 20:40:27	fungi	spi-general would be my default choice
2025-11-10 20:40:36	borden_	Maybe we can polish that up a bit, put it on an "job postings" link on the website
2025-11-10 20:40:51	fungi	not expecting answers but at least it's announced to the membership that way
2025-11-10 20:41:07	borden_	give it some time for search engines to index and anyone looking for a job should be able to find it
2025-11-10 20:41:57	fungi	i'm also happy to accept just about any process answer as long as it's something we can be more consistent about in the future. i have a personal policy about not engaging in bikeshed debates
2025-11-10 20:42:05	<--	borden (~borden@99.209.53.2) has quit (Ping timeout: 480 seconds)
2025-11-10 20:43:04	schultmc	A post to -general linking to a job postings section of the website seems prudent
2025-11-10 20:43:08	fungi	we've started to gain an increasing number of contractors, so having some semblance of a process around selecting them would be nice
2025-11-10 20:43:08	borden_	a website posting and mailing list blast should be sufficient
2025-11-10 20:43:24	mappx	+1
2025-11-10 20:43:51	fungi	but i don't want us to get wrapped up in unnecessary bureaucracy so any lightweight but repeatable process has my support
2025-11-10 20:44:04	borden_	organisations typically post opportunities on their own website. There's no positive obligation to engage every social media platform or something silly like that
2025-11-10 20:44:24	Jesusalva[m]	Yeah. I'll draft what we discussed now into a resolution for next meeting
2025-11-10 20:44:40	Jesusalva[m]	Please include my last statement to minutes
2025-11-10 20:44:50	fungi	duly noted
2025-11-10 20:45:06	fungi	i'm hoping to draft them immediately following the gavel
2025-11-10 20:45:17	Jesusalva[m]	I assume we're all in agreement for a website posting and mailing list as sufficient
2025-11-10 20:45:27	fungi	i am, at least, yes
2025-11-10 20:45:29	Jesusalva[m]	fungi: Feel free to beat me to it
2025-11-10 20:45:29	borden_	I am
2025-11-10 20:45:48	milan	+1
2025-11-10 20:46:06	fungi	by "draft them" i meant today's meeting minutes, to be clear
2025-11-10 20:46:14	schultmc	+1
2025-11-10 20:46:54	Jesusalva[m]	SGTM too :p
2025-11-10 20:47:24	Jesusalva[m]	I really don't mind if people do stuff, but I try to ensure stuff get done which often means doing them myself 😅
2025-11-10 20:47:44	fungi	sadly i know exactly what you mean

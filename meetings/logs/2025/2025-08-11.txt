2025-08-11 20:20:55	schultmc	as secretary for the previous term.

2025-08-11 20:24:41	borden	I'm too new, I think. I'd rather someone with experience.
2025-08-11 20:25:13	fsf	I'm hastily backpedaling so as to make it look like others are volunteering.
2025-08-11 20:25:48	Jesusalva[m]	I've been pulling double duty, but that's not sustainable long term due to the time investment necessary in each function. I can help, and we included Kassia to help
2025-08-11 20:26:01	Jesusalva[m]	But that's the most I can do :P

2025-08-11 20:27:09	Jesusalva[m]	Actually, that's an idea; fungi could step up to Secretary and someone else step up to his tasks

2025-08-11 20:32:39	schultmc	[item 9, Any other business]
2025-08-11 20:32:39	schultmc	Anything to discuss?
2025-08-11 20:32:39	schultmc	.
2025-08-11 20:32:39	schultmc	There are numerous potential topics in the agenda. Any director may discuss
2025-08-11 20:32:40	schultmc	any of these or any unlisted topic they feel should be discussed at this time.
2025-08-11 20:35:15	borden	I kinda appeared out of nowhere, so if anyone wants to know anything about me, I'm happy to answer.
2025-08-11 20:35:26	borden	(in my defence, I followed the mailing list for a few years)
2025-08-11 20:35:51	zumbi	borden: could you please introduce yourself and explain your past role in the FLOSS ecosystem?
2025-08-11 20:36:45	zumbi	also I would be curious to know what made you join SPI elections - I think it's great - but what motivation did you have?
2025-08-11 20:36:54	borden	Sure. So I've basically been using FLOSS software for the past 20 years. I'm not a programmer - I come from a business and accounting background - so there are no projects where I've made much of a contribution. Having said that, I'm trying to get involved in some documentation projects like the Debian wiki
2025-08-11 20:37:52	zumbi	That's interesting, maybe we can discuss sometime about accounting and wiki :-)
2025-08-11 20:37:52	borden	My motivation is basically to get some return on investment on all my business training. I have a BComm in accounting, an MBA and I passed the chartered accountancy exams in Ontario (where I live). As I mentioned in my platform, I hope that someone with a finance background can help
2025-08-11 20:38:30	mappx	for clarity, is that Ontario, Canada?
2025-08-11 20:38:44	borden	Unfortunately, my competence is in Canadian accounting standards and rules. I know almost nothing about American charity and NFP rules
2025-08-11 20:38:49	borden	correct, Ontario, Canada
2025-08-11 20:39:04	fungi	math is math ;)
2025-08-11 20:39:33	Jesusalva[m]	Hey, I'm a Brazilian accountant 
2025-08-11 20:39:33	zumbi	time for spi.ca? LOL
2025-08-11 20:39:45	Jesusalva[m]	We should get along well, thanks to IASB lol
2025-08-11 20:39:52	borden	True. I still remember some of my IFRS from school. Haven't used it much
2025-08-11 20:40:09	schultmc	If I wasn't in IT/InfoSec I'd be a CPA :)
2025-08-11 20:40:16	fungi	to be fair, usa organizational standards vary somewhat state to state, so there are about 50 possibilities
2025-08-11 20:41:07	mappx	borden: I am so happy that you are here! I am from the Smiths Falls area :)
2025-08-11 20:41:08	fungi	if i wasn't in it/infosec, i would definitely not be a cpa (math theory major and dropout)
2025-08-11 20:43:02	borden	mappx, I'm in Toronto, so a bit west
2025-08-11 20:43:19	Jesusalva[m]	I know no math
2025-08-11 20:43:30	borden	neither do CPAs, for that matter
2025-08-11 20:44:23	borden	But, yeah, if my book learning can be of any use, I'm happy to share it.
2025-08-11 20:45:57	fungi	thanks!
2025-08-11 20:47:54	schultmc	Anything further to discuss?
2025-08-11 20:48:55	jconway	nothing here
2025-08-11 20:49:26	fungi	nothing that wouldn't be handled better asynchronously outside the meeting anyway
2025-08-11 20:49:35	schultmc	+1
2025-08-11 20:49:48	zumbi	nothing from me
2025-08-11 20:49:53	schultmc	[item 10, Next board meeting]
2025-08-11 20:49:53	schultmc	The next board meeting is scheduled for: September 8, 2025 at 2000 UTC.
2025-08-11 20:49:55	schultmc	Any objections?
2025-08-11 20:49:58	milan	works for me
2025-08-11 20:50:03	schultmc	works for me
2025-08-11 20:50:07	Jesusalva[m]	Hmm 
2025-08-11 20:50:10	zumbi	fine for me
2025-08-11 20:50:15	Jesusalva[m]	Perdu question about elections?
2025-08-11 20:50:16	jconway	I will not be available for that one
2025-08-11 20:50:24	borden	I'm good
2025-08-11 20:50:31	Jesusalva[m]	Perdu asked who's supposed to see vote results 
2025-08-11 20:50:53	--	fungi has changed topic for #spi from "Next SPI board meeting is on August 11, 2025, 20:00 UTC on #spi. Agenda: https://www.spi-inc.org/meetings/agendas" to "Next SPI board meeting is on September 8, 2025, 20:00 UTC on #spi. Agenda: https://www.spi-inc.org/meetings/agendas"
2025-08-11 20:50:54	Jesusalva[m]	If only who started, all officers, all members...?
2025-08-11 20:51:32	schultmc	After an election closes, voting information (other than how an individual voted) should be public IMHO
2025-08-11 20:51:37	Perdu	Yea the system only allows vote starter to see results, which I'm not sure makes sense for results that are meant to be made public anyway
2025-08-11 20:53:36	Perdu	Looking at it, I don't think any former vote justify the information not be made public immediately. I'll patch that way
2025-08-11 20:53:37	<--	borden (~borden@76.9.197.103) has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2025-08-11 20:53:49	Jesusalva[m]	LGTM
2025-08-11 20:53:51	schultmc	Sounds good - thanks
2025-08-11 20:53:57	schultmc	*GAVEL*

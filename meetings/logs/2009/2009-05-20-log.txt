16:03 < schultmc> cdlu, luk: ping
16:03 < luk> Luk Claes
16:04 < Hydroxide> hrm. maybe people got thrown by the fact that the reminder was 48 hours in advance?
16:04 < Hydroxide> we have tentative regrets from Neil McGovern
16:04 < cdlu> David Graham
16:04 < Hydroxide> we need 1 more board member for quorum
16:05 < Hydroxide> can someone contact Bdale or Joshua or Martin?
16:05  * schultmc can call Josh
16:05 < Hydroxide> schultmc: Drake, remember, not Berkus. Thanks.
16:05 < schultmc> Hydroxide: I know
16:05 < Hydroxide> ok
16:06 < Hydroxide> for everyone who's here, look at the agenda if you haven't already: http://www.spi-inc.org/secretary/agenda/2009/2009-05-20.html
16:06 -!- linuxpoet [~jd@75.142.153.203] has joined #spi
16:06 < Ganneff> zobel wont, he is somewhere south france. no net
16:06 < linuxpoet> ji
16:06 < Hydroxide> linuxpoet: hi. state your name for the record, then we can begin
16:06 < linuxpoet> Joshua D. Drake
16:06 < Hydroxide> great. quorum.
16:06 < Hydroxide> no president's report.
16:06 < Hydroxide> schultmc: Treasurer's report. go! :)
16:07 < schultmc> A routine treasurer's report was sent out and is in the agenda
16:07 < Hydroxide> any questions or discussion regarding that?
16:07 < Hydroxide> no?
16:07 < schultmc> the bulk of April's donations were deposited on 2009-05-01 which is why this report shows a less than typical amount of income
16:08 < schultmc> </done>
16:08 < Hydroxide> schultmc: ah, that is a good point
16:08 < Hydroxide> schultmc: what happened with the form 990?
16:08 < Hydroxide> schultmc: has something been filed?
16:08 < schultmc> Hydroxide: the 2008 form 990 has not yet been filed - I need to get the appropriate data to the accountant
16:09 < Hydroxide> schultmc: did we at least file an extension? if I'm not mistaken (I may be), the deadline for filing that was May 15
16:09 < schultmc> Hydroxide: the accountant automatically files extenstions for us
16:09 < Hydroxide> schultmc: ok, good. so that actually happened?
16:09 < schultmc> Hydroxide: I believe so, yes
16:09 < Hydroxide> that's all from me. any other questions?
16:09 < cdlu> not from me 
16:09 < linuxpoet> I am good
16:09 < Hydroxide> OK, moving on. My Secretary's report is in the agenda
16:10 < Hydroxide> basically summarizing some SPI-related activity on behalf of DebConf10
16:10 < Hydroxide> I'm happy to answer any questions
16:10 < Hydroxide> anyone?
16:10 < linuxpoet> Not I
16:10 < devil> will this stuff be good for any non-debian members?
16:11 < devil> i would like to attend debconf10
16:11 < Ganneff> debconf isnt limited to debian people
16:11 < Hydroxide> devil: yes. if there's anyone who the DebConf organizers believe is honestly intending to attend DebConf and leave before the visa expires, and not immigrate illegally, we'll be glad to provide the same visa assistance.
16:11 < devil> i know
16:11 < Ganneff> so you can. you might not get travel sponsorship if unknown and lotsa others ask that are known, but you are welcome for sure.
16:11 < devil> Hydroxide: thxx
16:11 < Hydroxide> devil: being a Debian developer isn't necessary - in fact, although the person my report refers to does contribute to Debian, he's not a DD.
16:12 < Hydroxide> devil: even without our visa assistance, you're welcome to attend if you can get here :)
16:12 < Hydroxide> any other questions?
16:12 < Ganneff> like, we did have gentoo people in the past :)
16:12  * Hydroxide nods at Ganneff 
16:12 < devil> Hydroxide: well, i live in DE, so should be no prob really
16:12 < Hydroxide> devil: if you're a german citizen you don't need a visa
16:12 < Ganneff> now, thats not really for this meeting :)
16:12 < Hydroxide> right
16:12 < linuxpoet> where is debconf10 being held?
16:13 < Hydroxide> ok, moving on
16:13 < Hydroxide> oh
16:13 < devil> Hydroxide: ups, last time i visited US was ~ 25 years ago :)
16:13 < Hydroxide> linuxpoet: New York City
16:13 < Hydroxide> linuxpoet: columbia university
16:13 < linuxpoet> very cool
16:13 < Hydroxide> yes
16:13 < Hydroxide> any other questions from board members or directly report-related questions from anyone?
16:13 < Hydroxide> ok, moving on
16:14 < Hydroxide> Two sets of minutes to approve today. the first set was approved last month, but I made a typo in Julien Cristau's name (listed him as Jilien)
16:14 < Hydroxide> no other changes
16:14 < Hydroxide> any objection to voting on that?
16:14 < Ganneff> err
16:14 < Hydroxide> or should we just say "done, move on"
16:14 < Ganneff> we do not really have to vote on a name spelling fix?
16:14 < Ganneff> thats insane
16:14 < Hydroxide> ok
16:14 < cdlu> no objection to voting on it but it seems unnecessary. update the record and be done with it. :)
16:14 < Ganneff> thats no content change
16:14 < Hydroxide> I'll note that it was changed by unanimous consent
16:14 < Ganneff> none that matters.
16:14 < linuxpoet> agreed
16:14 < Hydroxide> next one: last month's
16:14 < cdlu> it's not like a vote changed :)
16:14 < Hydroxide> right
16:14 < Hydroxide> is everyone ready to vote on last month's minutes?
16:15 < jcristau> Ganneff: it matters a lot! :)

16:16 < Ganneff> my condolence
16:16  * Hydroxide grins at Ganneff 
16:16 < Hydroxide> anything else?
16:16 < cdlu> linuxpoet, happy birthday :)
16:16 < luk> happy birthday linuxpoet!
16:16 < linuxpoet> thanks guys
16:16 < schultmc> happy birthday!
16:16 < cdlu> hydroxide, I'd just like to point out that next meeting is the last before the 2009 general elections
16:16 < cdlu> hydroxide, if you want to start preparing the membership for that :)
16:17 < Hydroxide> cdlu: right. do we need to do anything about that between now and then?
16:17 < linuxpoet> We should start talking to -private about it
16:17 < Hydroxide> or does the membership committee?
16:17 < cdlu> make sure membership ctte is up to date and let people know how many seats are up for election so they can prepare to run
16:17 < cdlu> that's all
16:17 < Hydroxide> ok. does someone want to take charge of that?
16:17  * cdlu gestures toward the secretary and his responsibility to manage the election
16:17 < Hydroxide> fair enough :)
16:17 < cdlu> :)
16:17 < Hydroxide> I was going to be the default, but I thought I'd give people a chance to take the workload first
16:17 < Hydroxide> ok
16:17 < Hydroxide> I'll do it
16:18 < Hydroxide> any other business?
16:18 < linuxpoet> none here
16:18 < cdlu> not from me. I may not be able to attend June meeting, to be seen.
16:18 < Hydroxide> if not, the next board meeting would normally be Wednesday June 17th, 2009, same time of day (20:00 UTC)
16:18 < Hydroxide> any objections?
16:18 < schultmc> none here
16:18 < linuxpoet> None here
16:18 < Hydroxide> cdlu: would an alternative day or time work better for you?
16:18 < cdlu> hydroxide, not really. June's a chaotic month for me.
16:18 < Hydroxide> ok
16:19 < Hydroxide> I think that's everything. going once...
16:19 < Hydroxide> going twice...
16:19 < Hydroxide> *GAVEL*

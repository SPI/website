15:01 < Ganneff> schultmc - not here, so nothing
15:01 < Ganneff> [item 5, Secretary's report]
15:01 < Ganneff> Hydroxide: your time
15:01 < Hydroxide> right.
15:01 < Hydroxide> I put a secretary's report in the agenda with various updates. any questions?
15:01 < Ganneff> the git repo is there now.
15:01 < Ganneff> nothing much more done besides that.
15:02 < Hydroxide> ok
15:02 < Ganneff> done?
15:02 < linuxpoet> done
15:02 < Hydroxide> cdlu: the 3/19 meeting minutes link works for me
15:02 < Hydroxide> cdlu: it goes to http://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/meeting-minutes/2008/meeting-minutes-2008-03-19.txt/view
15:02 < Hydroxide> cdlu: clear your cache maybe
15:02 < Ganneff> [item 6, Outstanding minutes]
15:02 < Ganneff> Again for Hydroxide.
15:03 < cdlu> it works now
15:03 < Hydroxide> Last meeting's minutes are not yet ready due to me being sick - will have them for next meeting. We have three meeting minutes from before my term as Secretary, generously prepared by zobel 
15:03 < Hydroxide> thank you very much, Martin!
15:03 < Ganneff> lets vote. :)
15:03 < Hydroxide> one of them needs a few additional details to be added later, as per the agenda.
15:03 < Hydroxide> (that can be a separate vote, later, but we can approve what's there now)
15:03 < Hydroxide> we need three votes or one?
15:03  * Maulkin would suggest leaving one that isn't ready yet
15:04 < Hydroxide> I can do that too
15:04 < Maulkin> Just one? :)
15:04 < Hydroxide> the second and third are ready
15:04 < Ganneff> anyone against voting on both together?
15:04 < cdlu> anyone want to move for separation? :)
15:04  * cdlu is prepared to vote in bulk
15:04 < zobel> i will try to get the other three ready for next meeting, unless Maulkin will do it.
15:04 < linuxpoet> Considering I don't even remember the meeting, I am indifferent
15:04 < Ganneff> so lets do them together.
15:05 < luk> s/announced announced/announced/ for the May one

15:06 < Hydroxide> luk: try voting again
15:06 < Ganneff> dont confuse the script
15:06 < luk> !vote yes
15:06 < Hydroxide> luk: I'll fix the typo
15:06 < Hydroxide> Current voting results for "Approve April/May 2008 minutes": Yes: 6, No: 0, Abstain: 1, Missing: 0 ()
15:06 < Hydroxide> Voting for "Approve April/May 2008 minutes" closed.
15:06 < Hydroxide> good.
15:06 < Ganneff> good.
15:06 < Ganneff> thats all we have to vote on here, right?
15:06 < Hydroxide> as far as minutes, yes
15:06 < Hydroxide> next item is linuxpoet's resolution
15:07 < Ganneff> [item 7, Stuff for discussion]
15:07 < Ganneff> We seem to have 1 item here, "Resolution 2009-01-09.jdd.1 - New affiliated project: Helios Initiative (Joshua D. Drake)"
15:07 < linuxpoet> Right
15:07 < linuxpoet> I spoke with SFLC
15:07 < Hydroxide> lots of info in the agenda, previously sent to -private a while ago
15:07 < linuxpoet> I received the following:
15:07 < linuxpoet> Sounds great, but agree that there are certain considerations for handling these kinds of donations that you need to be careful about.
15:07 < linuxpoet> I'll need to do a little bit of research to refresh my memory and could get back to you Wednesday or Thursday. Is that soon enough?
15:07 < linuxpoet> From Karen Sandler
15:07 < linuxpoet> I have not heard as of yet
15:08 < Hydroxide> sounds like we'll probably be able to approve them in the end but might want to wait until February so we can hear from her?
15:08 < linuxpoet> I suggest we table voting until we have exact procedures required to ensure this will work appropriately
15:08  * Maulkin is unhappy on votingfor this without a legal brief
15:08  * Hydroxide agrees
15:08 < linuxpoet> Only question I have is, do we have to wait until Februrary?
15:08  * luk too
15:08 < Ganneff> same here.
15:08 < linuxpoet> If we get what we need in two days, can we hold an email vote?
15:08 < Ganneff> linuxpoet: well. we *can* do email votes, if really needed.
15:08 < Maulkin> But it'... interesting
15:08 < Hydroxide> linuxpoet: it's easiest. we may want clarifications, etc. and email votes are allowed but need 100% unanimity among all 9 board members under NY law
15:08 < Hydroxide> linuxpoet: (despite our bylaws)
15:09 < linuxpoet> Ahh so we need consent (same as Oregon law)
15:09 < cdlu> the procedure for email votes is arcane, we could always have a conditional vote now
15:09  * Hydroxide moves to wait until February on this resolution, pending legal advice from SFLC
15:09 < Maulkin> cdlu: wording?
15:09 < linuxpoet> I just hate to hold these guys off for another four weeks if we find out tomorrow
15:09 < cdlu> we approve helios contingent on nobody bringing up objections following our legal advice, or somesuch
15:09  * Ganneff moves for a vote under "its only valid if we get positive feedback from our lawyers"
15:09 < luk> linuxpoet: we could also agree to hold the February meeting earlier? :-)
15:10 < linuxpoet> True enough
15:10  * Hydroxide nods at luk 
15:10 < linuxpoet> O.k. how about that? 
15:10  * Hydroxide withdraws his motion
15:10 < cdlu> our by-laws allow a special meeting to be called 
15:10 < cdlu> we could just do that
15:10 < linuxpoet> +1
15:10 < Maulkin> What notice is needed?
15:10 < cdlu> when we get the legal advice, president+secretary call the meeting and off we go.
15:10 < cdlu> 2 weeks, like any meeting.
15:10 < Hydroxide> guys, it's easiest to just have an earlier february meeting
15:10 < Maulkin> That's a while...
15:11 < Maulkin> *shrug*
15:11 < luk> Maulkin: in 10 days it's February already :-)
15:11 < linuxpoet> If we need two weeks, let's just have next meeting first week of Feb
15:11 < cdlu> I think conditional approval now is our fastest, easiest, and best bet.
15:11 < Ganneff> ok. so this point is done for now, i think? 2 weeks should be ok, and we can move a meeting if need be.
15:11  * Maulkin nods at cdlu 
15:11 < Hydroxide> cdlu: there's also a defect in the resolution
15:11 < linuxpoet> There is?
15:11 < cdlu> ok, then defer it. I'm not partial. :)
15:12 < Hydroxide> cdlu: i.e. it doesn't include the backup liaison that the HeliOS's application email referred to
15:12  * Maulkin seconds Hydroxide to defer.
15:12 < Hydroxide> Ganneff: let's go on.
15:12  * cdlu thinks we have enough unvoted seconds to run us a whole hour
15:12 < Ganneff> [item 8, Next board meeting]
15:12 < Ganneff> Going with third Wed of months it should be on Wednesday, February 18th, 2009, 20:00 UTC. Unless we screw this later by mail.
15:12 < Maulkin> (we can recall it at a special if needed)
15:12  * Hydroxide moves to meet Feb 11th instead
15:12 < zobel> so no item up for discussion?! :)
15:12 < Hydroxide> and not worry about a special
15:12 < Hydroxide> any objection to the 11th?
15:13 < cdlu> long agenda, short meeting. foolproof. :)
15:13 < zobel> Hydroxide: no
15:13 < linuxpoet> 11th is beter for me
15:13 < cdlu> no objection here, but please send loud obnoxious reminders
15:13 < Maulkin> Apologies for me next month.
15:13 < Hydroxide> I will.
15:13 < linuxpoet> I travelling the week of the 18th
15:13 < Hydroxide> 11th going once...
15:13 < Ganneff> send reminders, twice. so its the 11th then.
15:13 < Hydroxide> twice...
15:13 < Hydroxide> good.
15:13 < Hydroxide> will send reminders.
15:13 < Ganneff> *GAVEL*

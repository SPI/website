20:13 #spi: < schultmc> I apologize for the delay - I mistakingly thought I had an extra week to prepare the report
20:13 #spi: < Ganneff> schultmc: your turn
20:13 #spi: < schultmc> nothing else from me unless there are questions
20:13 #spi: < Hydroxide> schultmc: same deal about the helios project, as usual?

20:16 #spi: < Ganneff> schultmc: did you deliver your treasurers report?
20:16 #spi:  * Ganneff never saw any
20:17 #spi: < Hydroxide> I think we're all on this side of the netsplit
20:17 #spi: < schultmc> Ganneff: yes
20:17 #spi: < Hydroxide> Ganneff: it is in the agenda
20:17 #spi: < Ganneff> and lag is going up again for me. how not helpful
20:17 #spi: < Hydroxide> I think we can go on... it'll become apparent very shortly if someone's not here as a vote is next
20:17 #spi: < schultmc> [15:12] <    schultmc> | routine report was just added to the agenda

20:17 #spi: < schultmc> [15:13] <    schultmc> | nothing else from me unless there are questions
20:19 #spi: < Ganneff> Hydroxide: it wont help to go on if i have a lag of two minutes and dont even see what people wrote.
20:19 #spi: < Ganneff> now, lets try a question i got from a guest:
20:19 #spi: < Ganneff> <jello> Why is the interest so low for $100k?
20:19 #spi: < zobel> Ganneff: go on?
20:19 #spi:  * Hydroxide agrees
20:19 #spi: < Hydroxide> heh...if ganneff is effectively not here due to technical issues then we no longer have quorum
20:19 #spi: < zobel> maybe he splitted away? :)
20:19 #spi: < Hydroxide> he's still on this side of the netsplit
20:20 #spi: < Ganneff> as i said, i experience lots of lag...
20:20 #spi: < luk__> I reconnected once I saw I had a way too big lag
20:20 #spi: < luk__> and that apparently has improved things
20:21 #spi: < Noodles> I understand there have been problems at LINX today, but I thought it was sorted.
20:21 #spi: < jello> schultmc: is there a typo on the interest income?  why so low?
20:21 #spi: < schultmc> no typo - apparently the bank lowered the interest rate
20:21 #spi: < Ganneff> anyone got my stuff, including jellos question?
20:21 #spi: < jello> hrmph
20:21 #spi: < jello> i currently get 1.5%, what are we getting from key?
20:22 #spi: < Noodles> Ganneff: Yes, I saw it.
20:22 #spi: < Hydroxide> schultmc: that's 0.004% ish ... really?

20:23 #spi: < schultmc> statement says APY is 0.05%
20:23 #spi: < Ganneff> oh yay, i just saw my earlier msgs
20:23 #spi: < schultmc> I'll call the bank and see what's changed
20:23 #spi: < Ganneff> lets try going on
20:23 #spi: < Ganneff> [item 5, Secretaries Report]
20:23 #spi: < jello> schultmc: thanks!
20:23 #spi: < Ganneff> And this is for Noodles.

20:26 #spi: < luk__> hmm
20:26 #spi: < zobel> Martin Zobel-Helas
20:26 #spi: < Noodles> This isn't really working, is it?
20:26 #spi: < Hydroxide> heh
20:26 #spi: < luk__> maybe now it is? :-)
20:26 #spi: < Ganneff> bad timing
20:26 #spi:  * Hydroxide is here - was briefly distracted by $paidjob, but only briefly
20:27 #spi:  * schultmc is still here
20:27 #spi: < Ganneff> i am here, but lag is not going down.
20:27 #spi: < schultmc> hopefuly this client and my backup client are on different servers
20:27 #spi: < Ganneff> if anyone has seen my paste, its noodles task right now
20:27 #spi: < Noodles> I didn't see it.
20:27 #spi: < Hydroxide> Noodles: secretary's report bit
20:27 #spi: < Ganneff> [item 5, Secretaries Report]
20:27 #spi: < Ganneff> And this is for Noodles.
20:27 #spi: < Noodles> I also didn't see any reply to the "only 0.004%?"
20:28 #spi: < Ganneff> there, for those that missed it
20:28 #spi: < luk__> tnx
20:28 #spi: < schultmc> Noodles: [15:23] <    schultmc> | statement says APY is 0.05%
20:28 #spi: < schultmc> [15:23] <     Ganneff> | oh yay, i just saw my earlier msgs
20:28 #spi: < schultmc> [15:23] <    schultmc> | I'll call the bank and see what's changed
20:28 #spi: < Hydroxide> schultmc said the bank gave us an APY of 0.05% ... but, I forgot to take into account that that's annual and this is a monthly report
20:28 #spi: < Hydroxide> so it probably makes sense if I were to do the math
20:28 #spi: < Hydroxide> still crap though
20:28 #spi: < Hydroxide> (but common)
20:29 #spi: < Ganneff> (i do not envy those that try to make this log into meeting minutes or blog posts or mailing list mails)
20:29 #spi:  * Hydroxide will discuss higher-yield alternatives with schultmc as part of opening the account we agreed in September
20:29 #spi: < zobel> Noodles: can you go on with secretary report?
20:29 -!- yp17 [~yp17@fac34-1-82-224-137-145.fbx.proxad.net] has joined #spi
20:29 #spi: < Noodles> I believe secretary stuff is now up to date; I have all outstanding minutes (the 2 Martin did I'll get on the agenda for next month).
20:29 #spi: < Noodles> The 2 pending applications for associated membership are both on today's agenda.
20:30 #spi: < luk__> time to vote on the minutes of Nov I guess?
20:30 #spi: < Hydroxide> Ganneff: go ahead and move onto the next item - the November minutes. then noodles can call a vote.
20:30 #spi: < Ganneff> they are in next point. we have minutes to vote on, i think?
20:30 #spi: < zobel> done?
20:30 #spi: < Ganneff> Hydroxide: thats in the secretary part anyways.
20:30 #spi: < Noodles> I'm done with secretary stuff, yes. Minute voting time?
20:30 #spi: < Ganneff> yes
20:30 #spi: < Hydroxide> Ganneff: usually been a separate item in the past but I don't really care

20:32 #spi: < Ganneff> I think we have YafaRay and sidux here. Again the floor for Noodles.
20:33 #spi: < Noodles> I have no association with either project. Both seem suited to our aims and have been messed around a bit in terms of a delay in getting these resolutions drafted.
20:33 #spi: < Noodles> I found both liasions responsive when I was sorting out the details.
20:33 #spi: < Ganneff> anyone having trouble with one of em? if not, ready to vote?
20:34 #spi: < zobel> Noodles: very diplomatic, thx :)

20:36 #spi: < Ganneff> so this is done, i think. thanks, lets go on.
20:36 #spi: < Ganneff> [item 7, Any other business]
20:36 #spi: < Ganneff> Anyone with a topic?
20:36 #spi:  * Hydroxide has had multiple more brief $paidjob interruptions - sorry for the delays
20:36 #spi: < zobel> congrats to both projects.
20:37 #spi: < zobel> none?
20:37 #spi:  * Hydroxide reminds Noodles that someone still needs to email them and get an acceptance response with 60 days - likely trivial but still important
20:37 #spi: < Ganneff> going once
20:37 #spi: < Noodles> Hydroxide: Yup, I think I've seen bdale do that in the past but I can do it.
20:37 #spi: < zobel> Ganneff: status DOT?
20:37 #spi: < Ganneff> discussion
20:37 #spi: < Ganneff> discussion
20:37 #spi: < Ganneff> and more of it.
20:38 #spi: < Ganneff> but only ever briefly, then silence. then... :)
20:38 #spi: < Ganneff> going twice
20:38 #spi: < Hydroxide> Noodles: great. when a project rep is present in-meeting we can do it during the meeting on IRC for the record, but that's not true here. there's no more to it than you think.
20:38 #spi: < Hydroxide> Ganneff: move on to 'next meeting' :)
20:38 #spi: < Noodles> I'd like to push back the meeting next month by an hour if possible. I'm going to be in Sydney so 20:00 UTC is 07:00 I think.
20:38 #spi: < devil> Hydroxide: i am here
20:38 #spi: < Ganneff> impatient lot
20:38 #spi: < Ganneff> [item 8, Next board meeting]
20:38 #spi: < Ganneff> If I am right this will be the 14th January, again 20:00 UTC
20:38 #spi: < Ganneff> ok
20:38 #spi: < Ganneff> with noodles that would be 2100 utc
20:38 #spi: < Ganneff> anyone trouble with that?
20:39 #spi: < schultmc> fine with me
20:39 #spi:  * Hydroxide doesn't mind but suggest that we allow devil to accept on behalf of sidux before we close
20:39 #spi: < luk__> nope, just have to remember :-)
20:39 #spi: < zobel> noe, even better for me... my daughter in bed then... :)
20:39 #spi: < Ganneff> lets take it for 2100 then, and if needed people complain on list
20:40 #spi: < Ganneff> devil: do you want to accept sidux right now in this meeting? or want a mail?
20:40 #spi: < devil> i accept for project sidux, thanks
20:40 #spi: < Noodles> Welcome aboard.
20:40 #spi: < Ganneff> great. welcome.

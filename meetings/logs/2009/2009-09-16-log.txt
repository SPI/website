 09/16/09 [22:03:37]< schultmc> A routine treasurer's report is in the agenda.  I'm again happy to see projects spending funds rather than continuing to hoard them.
 09/16/09 [22:03:45]< bdale> agreed

 09/16/09 [22:04:21]< Noodles> Not from me.

 09/16/09 [22:05:34]< bdale> Martin?
 09/16/09 [22:05:58]< zobel> Hydroxide: did you finish yours?
 09/16/09 [22:06:17]< bdale> we appear to have one set to vote on, from last month
 09/16/09 [22:06:43]< bdale> or not?
 09/16/09 [22:06:44]< zobel> i havend seen any from Hydroxide send to secretary, so we don't have the one from last month
 09/16/09 [22:06:59]< bdale> ok, I see, it's on the agenda but without a link to the draft ... never mind
 09/16/09 [22:07:00]< Noodles> Yeah, they haven't been sent that I've seen either so I don't think there's anything to vote on.
 09/16/09 [22:07:16]< bdale> hopefully we can have those ready by our next meeting
 09/16/09 [22:07:25]< Hydroxide> sorry ... yeah I have been busy preparing a NYLUG presentation for tonight

 09/16/09 [22:07:36]< bdale> [item 7.1, SPI resolution 2009-09-16.mcs.1 (Establishing an additional SPI bank account)]
 09/16/09 [22:07:36]< bdale> This seems straight-forward to me.  Michael?
 09/16/09 [22:07:39]< Hydroxide> I'll have it by October.
 09/16/09 [22:07:49]< linuxpoet> Why do we need a resolution for this?
 09/16/09 [22:08:02]< bdale> linuxpoet: not clear to me either, really
 09/16/09 [22:08:05]< linuxpoet> This is purely operational and falls directly under treasurer duties (I would think)
 09/16/09 [22:08:06]< Hydroxide> linuxpoet: banks like to see a resolution authorizing bank account openings
 09/16/09 [22:08:11]< linuxpoet> Oh
 09/16/09 [22:08:12]< Hydroxide> linuxpoet: that's purely it
 09/16/09 [22:08:12]< linuxpoet> o.k.
 09/16/09 [22:08:13]< bdale> oh, right
 09/16/09 [22:08:13]< linuxpoet> :)
 09/16/09 [22:08:22]< Hydroxide> zobel: do you have the vote script?
 09/16/09 [22:08:22] * cdlu moves the motion
 09/16/09 [22:08:24]< bdale> ok, fair enough.  any dicussion, or can we vote?
 09/16/09 [22:08:26]< schultmc> linuxpoet: banks tend to require resolutions for corporate accounts
 09/16/09 [22:08:29]< zobel> Hydroxide: no
 09/16/09 [22:08:33]< Hydroxide> zobel: will set you up late

 09/16/09 [22:11:06]< Hydroxide> to me too
 09/16/09 [22:11:14]< bdale> any discussion?
 09/16/09 [22:11:30] * Hydroxide ready to vote unless there are questions
 09/16/09 [22:11:43]< cdlu> it (and the next one) seem to have generated no controversy whatsoever

 09/16/09 [22:12:50]< Hydroxide> as am I.
 09/16/09 [22:13:03]< Noodles> Yeah, I read some of the old archives and the letter and I'm happy with SFLC response.

 09/16/09 [22:14:04]< bdale> There was a bunch of discussion about this on-channel but I gather no formal amendments were proposed?
 09/16/09 [22:14:04]< bdale> I generally support this resolution, but personally would prefer a ping-those-who-don't-vote alternative to the current paragraph 5.
 09/16/09 [22:14:04]< bdale> David, want to add anything?
 09/16/09 [22:14:24]< Hydroxide> who wants to do the honor of emailing codestr0m (CCing board@ and optionally secretary@) to notify him and request acceptance?
 09/16/09 [22:14:24]< cdlu> it's generated a lot of discussion but no amendments or counter-proposals
 09/16/09 [22:14:29]< Noodles> I would want to see a ping-people-after-no-vote or a 2-missed-vote-requirement.
 09/16/09 [22:14:43]< bdale> Hydroxide: zobel can do that... ;-)
 09/16/09 [22:14:47]< Hydroxide> bdale: ok :)
 09/16/09 [22:14:51]< Noodles> I didn't propose an amendment because there seemed to be a feeling amongst the members that they didn't want it voted on this meeting but wanted more of a heads up.
 09/16/09 [22:14:55]< zobel> will do, but not now.
 09/16/09 [22:14:56]< bdale> zobel: I'll help if you like
 09/16/09 [22:15:02]< cdlu> noodles, I'd be good with something like that, although I don't want to add any workload to membership ctte
 09/16/09 [22:15:02]< bdale> sure, no huge rush
 09/16/09 [22:15:08]< Hydroxide> zobel: ok. I don't think we're going to have a lapsed invitation this time :)
 09/16/09 [22:15:10]< cdlu> idea is something that's easy clear and largely automated
 09/16/09 [22:15:11]< jberkus> bdale, cdlu: amendments were proposeld
 09/16/09 [22:15:17]< Noodles> cdlu: I think the "auto-ping" thing if it /can/ be automated is best?
 09/16/09 [22:15:19]< cdlu> jberkus, changes were suggested
 09/16/09 [22:15:23]< Hydroxide> jberkus: general ideas were proposed - no particular wording
 09/16/09 [22:15:27]< cdlu> Noodles, likely yes
 09/16/09 [22:15:29] * bdale is behind on email, as usual
 09/16/09 [22:15:40]< schultmc> cdlu: if we can fix the membership app, the workload wouldn't be overwhelming
 09/16/09 [22:15:52]< linuxpoet> That's on me
 09/16/09 [22:15:58] * Hydroxide moves that we all try to work together and with the members to come up with an amended/alternative resolution to vote on in October, and not vote on cdlu's today
 09/16/09 [22:16:00]< cdlu> schultmc, ok, well I defer to your judgement on implementation
 09/16/09 [22:16:02]< linuxpoet> We have a volunteer I just to be honest have been slacking
 09/16/09 [22:16:10]< cdlu> how would membership ctte like to do this? (answer on list)
 09/16/09 [22:16:12]-!- MrBeige [~richard@c-76-30-67-89.hsd1.tx.comcast.net] has joined #spi
 09/16/09 [22:16:12]-!- MrBeige is "Richard Darst" on #spi #debconf-team #meetbot #debian-nyc #debconf-nyc
 09/16/09 [22:16:18]< bdale> cdlu: are you ok with Hydroxide's suggestion?
 09/16/09 [22:16:19]< cdlu> I'd like to defer the resolution now that it's out for all to see and discuss :)
 09/16/09 [22:16:27]< schultmc> cdlu: luk or I can follow up on list
 09/16/09 [22:16:29]< cdlu> ya, that's fine
 09/16/09 [22:16:32]< bdale> ok
 09/16/09 [22:16:33]< cdlu> schultmc, great, thanks
 09/16/09 [22:16:37]< schultmc> or Maulkin if he's still on the ctte
 09/16/09 [22:16:46]< cdlu> I think Maulkin's busy trying to save the world 
 09/16/09 [22:16:50]< bdale> then we'll defer this to next month.  if folks have time to stay on channel and discuss after the meeting closes, that might be productive.
 09/16/09 [22:16:59]< bdale> [item 8, Any other business]
 09/16/09 [22:16:59]< bdale> Do any board members have other items for discussion they would like to address briefly?
 09/16/09 [22:17:13]< zobel> no
 09/16/09 [22:17:16]< Noodles> We mentioned moving the day for meetings last month.
 09/16/09 [22:17:26]< Ganneff> ay
 09/16/09 [22:17:30]< Noodles> I think Ganneff prefered a week earlier?
 09/16/09 [22:17:35]< Maulkin> Hrm?
 09/16/09 [22:17:37]< cdlu> brief note, doesn't need to go on the record. OFTC will be approaching SPI about our next election soon.
 09/16/09 [22:17:40]< Maulkin> What what?
 09/16/09 [22:17:41]< Ganneff> or later.
 09/16/09 [22:17:45]< schultmc> Not Monday or Not 1st Wednesday are fine with me
 09/16/09 [22:17:53]< Noodles> I didn't like last Wednesday of the month. :)
 09/16/09 [22:17:59]< Noodles> 2nd Wednesday didn't seem to upset anyone?
 09/16/09 [22:18:02]< Ganneff> right. so one week earlier
 09/16/09 [22:18:10]< bdale> next month, I'll be in Tokyo on the 21st, so a move to a week earlier would be good for me ... a week later and I'd still be in Japan
 09/16/09 [22:18:29]< bdale> so we're talking about 14 October at 20:00 UTC?
 09/16/09 [22:18:30]< Ganneff> i have on emore thing, just informational: down in .tw next week, discussion of .tw and spi and whatever they want down there.
 09/16/09 [22:18:32] * cdlu is wide open
 09/16/09 [22:18:32]< Noodles> I'm in California for both the 14th and 21st next month.
 09/16/09 [22:18:41]< bdale> Ganneff: we'll look forward to a report
 09/16/09 [22:18:46]< Noodles> Working, so I might have to miss the meeting, but I'll do my best to clear time for it.
 09/16/09 [22:18:49] * Hydroxide moves to move our default meeting time, starting next month, to 2nd wednesday of the month at 20:00 UTC
 09/16/09 [22:19:03]< Hydroxide> Noodles: welcome to how all of us in the US cope with the meeting time :)

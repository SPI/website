20:05 #spi: < Ganneff> [item 3, President's Report]
20:05 #spi: < Ganneff> Agenda looks like there is none, and Bdale is out anyways, so next
20:05 #spi: < Ganneff> [item 4, Treasurer's Report]
20:05 #spi: < Ganneff> Thats for Michael
20:05 #spi: < schultmc> bdale and zobel absent but we're quorate
20:05 #spi: < schultmc> standard report was e-mailed out and is in the agenda.  Nothing of note
20:05 #spi: < Hydroxide> schultmc: reports looks reasonable. one question - what are the debconf13 processing fees?
20:05 #spi: < Hydroxide> 0.43 looks remarkably low for all the other numbers
20:06 #spi: < Hydroxide> was most of the income a check with a tiny bit of credit card?
20:06 #spi: < schultmc> Hydroxide: someone donated $2 to DC13 via click and pledge
20:06 #spi: < schultmc> the other DC13 "income" is a transfer of the bulk of the left over DC12 funds to the DC13 "account"
20:07 #spi: < Hydroxide> schultmc: yup, so it's that kind of thing
20:07 #spi: < Hydroxide> sounds good

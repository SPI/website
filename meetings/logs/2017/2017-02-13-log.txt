21:01 < xnox> Dimitri John Ledkov
21:02 < tbm> I saw regrets from Zobel
21:03 < tbm> Looks like we don't have quorum
21:04 < xnox> we will have quorum in nyc
21:04 < tbm> Yes
21:04 < xnox> are there things we should discuss anyway?
21:04 < tbm> And there's nothing on the agenda that can't wait until next week
21:04 < schultmc> we had a meeting at the f2f last year too iirc
21:04 < tbm> I think the idea of having an irc meeting before the f2f was to get admin stuff out of the way
21:04 < tbm> so we can focus on big picture stuff at the f2f
21:05 < tbm> but there's not much admin stuff right now anyway
21:05 < tbm> so let's just meeting next week
21:05 < spectranaut> cool well see you all there :)
21:05 < tbm> safe travels everyone
21:05 < tbm> apart from the f2f
21:05 < tbm> [item 9, Next board meeting]

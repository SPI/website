21:34 #spi: < Ganneff> Noodles: I think we have two sets to vote on?
21:34 #spi: < Noodles> We did the Fluxbox vote via email.

21:36 #spi: < Ganneff> right, thanks
21:36 #spi: < Ganneff> [item 7, Stuff for discussion]
21:36 #spi: < Ganneff> Nothing I think.
21:37 #spi: < Solver> General business?
21:37 #spi: < Ganneff> [item 8, AOB]
21:37 #spi: < Ganneff> Anyone anything?
21:37 #spi: < Ganneff> Actually, I have one thing myself: OFTC has had its yearly elections, which naturally let to some changes inside staff. The voters also unanimously decided in favor of remaining in "Software in the Public Interest.", so hurray, we stay another year. :)
21:37 #spi: < Noodles> Cool.
21:37 #spi: < Ganneff> s/let/led/
21:37 #spi: < Solver> a couple of things I'd like to mention
21:37 #spi: < Noodles> Do people want to suggest a better day for meetings?
21:37 #spi: < bdale> BDALE GARBEE
21:37 #spi: < Noodles> Also what's happening with LanguageTool?
21:38 #spi: < Ganneff> right. lets see the day first. which one would be better?
21:38 #spi: < Solver> I wish for it to be Monday-Friday my timezone only
21:38 #spi: < Ganneff> run a doodle and see what comes out?
21:38 #spi: < zobel> monday, tuesday or thursday meet better for me
21:38 #spi: < Noodles> Thursdays?
21:38 #spi: < bdale> The day doesn't matter, but this is not a great time
21:38 #spi: < Solver> sure - that would be Friday for me which is fine
21:38 #spi: < schultmc> thursday works for me usually
21:38 #spi: < Solver> I have no preference on time
21:38 #spi:  * Clint is okay with thursday
21:39 #spi: < Ganneff> ok, thursday works here too, so that seems to be a good day
21:39 #spi: < Noodles> I'm not sure we can do much with the time?
21:39 #spi: < Ganneff> now, time...
21:39 #spi: < linuxpoet> we could push it back an hour
21:39 #spi: < Noodles> That's hard for .eu
21:39 #spi: < zobel> to? 20:30 UTC?
21:39 #spi: < Ganneff> its already 2230 in .eu now
21:39 #spi: < Solver> push it forward again?
21:39 #spi: < bdale> 30 minutes either way would help me
21:39 #spi: < Solver> makes it 6:30am for me which I'm fine with
21:39 #spi: < Ganneff> when we start, so going backwards isnt so nice
21:40 #spi: < Solver> ok push forward 30 mins?
21:40 #spi: < Clint> does that mean 2100?
21:40 #spi: < linuxpoet> 1400 west coast
21:40 #spi: < Hydroxide> eep
21:40 #spi: < Ganneff> 21 utc or 22 utc?
21:40 #spi: < Noodles> 1400 West Coast is 22 UTC at present.
21:40 #spi: < Hydroxide> can I make quorum if I show now?
21:40 #spi: < Noodles> Hydroxide: You and bdale get to make partially-present.
21:41 #spi: < zobel> 2100 utc please....
21:41 #spi: < Hydroxide> heh, ok :)
21:41 #spi: < schultmc> I'd prefer 2100 over 2200
21:41 #spi: < zobel> Hydroxide: tell your name! :)
21:41 #spi: < Noodles> 2100 UTC is 1300 US/Pacific which is awkward for me but I can do if it's better for everyone else.
21:41 #spi: < Solver> hmm I'll revise my statement and say that I'd prefer 2100 over 2200 too
21:41 #spi: < Hydroxide> Jimmy Kaplowitz, for the record. apologies for mostly missing it.
21:41 #spi: < linuxpoet> 1300 is better than 1330 for me
21:41 #spi: < Ganneff> 21 utc sounds nice, so lets try this
21:42 #spi: < bdale> 2100 better than 2200
21:42 #spi: < Noodles> So. 2100 UTC on Thursday?
21:42 #spi: < Ganneff> ay
21:42 #spi: < zobel> ack.
21:42 #spi: < Solver> seems like a concensus
21:42 #spi: < Ganneff> so, next AOB
21:42 #spi: < Noodles> (Potentially changing next time DST kicks in.)
21:42 #spi: < Ganneff> noodles had two
21:42 #spi: < Clint> !consense yes
21:42 #spi: < Ganneff> then Solver
21:42 #spi: < Noodles> Ganneff: One was the day/time which we've sorted.
21:42 #spi: < Ganneff> LanguageTool was the other
21:42 #spi: < Noodles> The other was just a query.
21:42 #spi: < Noodles> I think linuxpoet was dealing with it?
21:42 #spi:  * Ganneff has no idea
21:43 #spi: < linuxpoet> blink
21:43 #spi: < linuxpoet> I was doing what now?
21:43 #spi: < Noodles> Oh, do I have the wrong Josh?
21:43 #spi: < Ganneff> hrmwell. then lets sort this outside meeting, maybe by mail?
21:43 #spi: < linuxpoet> nod
21:43 #spi: < Ganneff> then the floor is for Solver. speak up, or never again. :)
21:43 #spi: < Solver> haha
21:43 #spi: < Noodles> Ah, yes, it was Berkus, not Drake. Sorry for the confusion.
21:43 #spi: < Solver> D&O insurance
21:44 #spi: < Noodles> Someone was to get numbers?
21:44 #spi: < Solver> Hydroxide: you were going to try to get some numbers?
21:44 #spi: < Solver> any luck
21:44 #spi: < Hydroxide> that I didn't get to. I have been overwhelmed by a successful-I-think job search. will do for next mo.
21:44 #spi: < Solver> np thanks :)
21:45 #spi: < Hydroxide> thanks for the ping.
21:45 #spi: < Solver> I would like us to have a restricted access repo
21:45 #spi: < Solver> I asked on the list and bdale indicated he didn't have a problem with it but I didn't hear from anyone else
21:45 #spi: < Ganneff> do we have something to actually put in there?
21:45 #spi: < Hydroxide> +1
21:45 #spi: < Solver> there is some stuff I think we should push up there
21:45 #spi: < Hydroxide> Ganneff: director contact info
21:46 #spi: < Ganneff> ok. fine. done. next.
21:46 #spi: < Solver> Ganneff: offline contact details for board, at least
21:46 #spi: < Hydroxide> not much else.
21:46 #spi: < zobel> what will we do re debian.eu? do we want mishi to do any other try or do we want to start the adr?
21:46 #spi: < Solver> Ganneff: I'm sure other stuff will come up
21:46 #spi: < zobel> or should we ask dpl@debian.org?
21:46 #spi: < Noodles> Has someone made a call to the registrant yet?
21:46 #spi: < zobel> nack
21:46 #spi: < jcristau> zobel: it's leader@ :)
21:46 #spi: < Noodles> I thought that was what we were waiting on.
21:46 #spi: < Ganneff> zobel: dpl has given it to us, i think we can start adr if we want to
21:47 #spi: < Noodles> Mishi suggested trying a phone call before ADR.
21:47 #spi: < bdale> makes sense
21:47 #spi: < Ganneff> zobel: can you do a call?
21:47 #spi: < Hydroxide> we might also need to wait until the EU trademark opposition period ends next May
21:47 #spi: < Hydroxide> though I'm not sure.
21:48 #spi: < Solver> I'm sure our lawyers can clarify that
21:48 #spi: < zobel> i will be loaded with work at work until end of february. i currently make ~8-12h overhours a week atm
21:48 #spi: < Hydroxide> Solver: yes.
21:48 #spi: < zobel> so... no
21:48 #spi: < zobel> Ganneff: ^
21:48 #spi: < bdale> Noodles: btw, got caught in a 3g fade, were we quorate to vote on previous mtg minutes?
21:48 #spi: < Noodles> bdale: Yes, we had 7 people voting.
21:48 #spi: < bdale> cool
21:49 #spi: < Ganneff> hrmpf. this sucks. ok, i try to do a phone call
21:49 #spi: < zobel> Ganneff: can you do, or should we ask mishi to do so? 
21:49 #spi: < Ganneff> mishi?
21:49 #spi: < Noodles> Zack offered to do it I think.
21:49 #spi: < Noodles> If we couldn't.
21:49 #spi: < Hydroxide> the lawyer
21:49 #spi: < Ganneff> ah
21:49 #spi: < Ganneff> well. i can try. not sure i get much done. (oh and i hate phoning). but meh
21:49 #spi: < zobel> maybe its not a bad idea to have a lawyer do the phone call...
21:50 #spi: < bdale> I agree
21:50 #spi: < Hydroxide> zobel: at this point I probably agree.
21:50 #spi: < Solver> or at least be on the call...
21:50 #spi: < Ganneff> well, yes
21:50 #spi: < Ganneff> ok. who asks mishi?
21:50 #spi: < zobel> Hydroxide had close worked with her....
21:51 #spi: < Hydroxide> I can, sure. not hard to do tonight.
21:51 #spi: < Ganneff> thanks
21:51 #spi: < Hydroxide> np
21:51 #spi: < Ganneff> so, any other AOB out there?
21:51 #spi: < bdale> not me
21:51 #spi: < linuxpoet> not me
21:51 #spi: < Ganneff> [item 9, Next board meeting]

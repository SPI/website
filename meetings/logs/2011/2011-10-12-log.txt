21:30 #spi: < Noodles> [item 1, Opening] Welcome to today's Software in the Public Interest board of directors meeting, which is now called to order.
21:30 #spi: < Noodles> Today's agenda and details of pending resolutions can be found on the web at: http://www.spi-inc.org/meetings/agendas/2011/2011-10-12/
21:30 #spi: < Noodles> [item 2, Roll Call]
21:30 #spi: < Noodles> Board members, please state your name for the record.  As we have nine board members, quorum for today's meeting is six.
21:30 #spi: < Noodles> Guests (including board advisors), please /msg your names to me (Noodles) if you wish your attendance to be recorded in the minutes of this meeting.
21:30 #spi: < zobel> Martin Zobel-Helas
21:30 #spi: < Solver> Robert Brockway
21:30 #spi: < Noodles> Jonathan McDowell
21:30 #spi: < Hydroxide> Jimmy Kaplowitz
21:31 #spi: < schultmc> Michael Schultheiss
21:31 #spi: < Noodles> Regrets have been received from Ganneff, bdale and schultmc (who's turned up anyway).
21:32 #spi: < Hydroxide> if we can find Joshua Drake, we actually have quorum
21:32 #spi: < Hydroxide> or Clint Adams, actually
21:32 #spi: < schultmc> I may need to leave shortly but thought I'd connect while around
21:32 #spi: < Noodles> So ideally we need both to maintain quorum.
21:33 #spi: < zobel> can someone who has the numbers SMS the both?
21:34 #spi: < Hydroxide> I just /msg'ed clint - surprisingly I don't have his phone number even though I live in the same city
21:34 #spi: < Noodles> I don't think I have details for either of them.
21:34 #spi: < Solver> We should fix that
21:34 #spi: < Hydroxide> yes
21:35 #spi: < Solver> We know where Clint works right?  so we could call there
21:35 #spi: < Hydroxide> well, for the directors and members/observers who are here: we will probably proceed to vote on the Fluxbox resolution via email - I don't think there's a reason to go to great lengths to do it during the meeting, since it's not controversial and the required unanimity for email voting should be doable
21:36 #spi: < Hydroxide> similarly, I don't think there's a reason to go to great lengths to get the minutes approved today as opposed to next meeting, if quorum is an obstacle
21:36 #spi: < Noodles> Agreed; we don't have anything that urgent outstanding.
21:36 #spi: < Noodles> I did wonder if we wanted to change our timings given the end of Northern Hemisphere daylight savings.
21:36 #spi: < Noodles> (Read: It would be convenient to me if we did so.)
21:37 #spi: < Solver> earlier or later?
21:37 #spi: < zobel> Noodles: we depend on Solver here
21:37 #spi: < Noodles> But I'm not sure if that then causes Solver issues?
21:37 #spi: < Noodles> Solver: 1 hour later, so it stays at 1:30pm local time for me.
21:37 #spi: < Hydroxide> Noodles: we can discuss that, certainly. :) none of the other absences seem to be a recurring thing, though. multiple unrelated one-off conflicts
21:37 #spi: < Solver> ah so it would go from 6:30am to 7:30am for me then
21:37 #spi: < Solver> either is fine for me
21:37 #spi: < Noodles> zobel: Does that work for you? I know you've prefered earlier times?
21:39 #spi: < zobel> DST ends here by end of October, which should result for Ganneff and me to be 22:30 again.
21:39 #spi: < zobel> so yes
21:39 #spi: < zobel> if i calculated the right way.
21:39 #spi: < Hydroxide> I'm fine with either time myself, though we should email the board about any proposed changes to see what the remaining 4 directors have to say, and also make the change evident from our email announcements
21:39 #spi: < zobel> i hate DST.... 
21:40 #spi: < Hydroxide> zobel: yes, I believe both North American and European DST/summer time end between this meeting and next
21:40 #spi: < Noodles> Yes, I'll mail board@, just wanted to check it suited people here first - I think we span the entire board timezone range at present. :)
21:40 #spi: < Hydroxide> we do :-)
21:40 #spi: < Noodles> Can I suggest we abandon the meeting? It's been 10 minutes and no sign of Clint or Joshua.
21:40 #spi: < zobel> Clint: ^
21:40 #spi: < Solver> np.  while we are here I did want to raise one thing informally
21:40 #spi: < Hydroxide> so, just to be clear, the time would be 19:30 UTC on the second wednesday of each month until further notice (such as around the start of DST 2012)?
21:41 #spi: < Solver> Hydroxide and i discussed it yesterday
21:41 #spi: < Noodles> Hydroxide: That sounds correct.
21:41 #spi: < Hydroxide> cool
21:41 #spi: < Solver> I just wanted to get thoughts on D&O insurance as posted to -board a while back
21:41 #spi: < Noodles> We would maintain a meeting time of 20:30 London Local Time. :)
21:41 #spi: < Noodles> No. That's not right. Er. 21:30 UTC.
21:42 #spi: < zobel> for me personaly it would help to move away from wednesday, but i fear that will not happen soon
21:42 #spi: < Solver> I'm flexible on day
21:42 #spi: < Hydroxide> I don't have a strong day pref.
21:42 #spi: < Solver> being early morning here I don't have committments at this time of the morning :)
21:43 #spi: < zobel> i miss every second meeting of our ambulance unit atm...
21:43 #spi: < Noodles> I think Tuesday would be tricky for me (I have a 2pm meeting), but other than that I'm flexible.
21:43 #spi: < zobel> du to time conflict.
21:43 #spi: < Solver> zobel: ah bummer.  I'd be ok with a change
21:43 #spi: < Noodles> We should probably have a list discussion.
21:44 #spi: < Hydroxide> ok
21:45 #spi: < Solver> sounds good.  Any thoughts on D&O?  We'd like to get pricing and present it to the board
21:45 #spi: < Noodles> I think getting pricing is reasonable.
21:45 #spi: < Noodles> I've no idea how much such things cost.
21:45 #spi: < Solver> not expensive in my experience
21:46 #spi: < Hydroxide> ok, I'm willing to make some phone calls / Internet inquiries and have some info within the next month
21:46 #spi: < Solver> great thanks
21:48 #spi: < Noodles> I suppose I should::

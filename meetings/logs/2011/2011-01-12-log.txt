20:32 #spi: < bdale> Michael?
20:32 #spi: < schultmc> standard report is in the agenda
20:33 #spi: < schultmc> Jimmy did have a question about the transaction fees in SPI's expenses.  Those are related to the credit card processing.
20:33 #spi: < bdale> any questions or comments?
20:33 #spi: < bdale> right, ok 
20:33 #spi: < Hydroxide> what credit card processing is so different this time to result in that large amount?
20:33 #spi: < schultmc> they're higher than past fees - I'll be reviewing our credit card processing to determine why the difference
20:33 #spi: < bdale> end of year charitable bulge?
20:33 #spi: < schultmc> I'll report back what if any issue there was
20:34 #spi: < bdale> ok
20:34 #spi: < Hydroxide> schultmc: ok. maybe also let us know why it's SPI-general instead of projects-allocable?
20:34 #spi: < bdale> anything worth reporting on the filings with NY charities folks?
20:34 #spi: < Hydroxide> (when you report back)
20:34 #spi: < schultmc> Hydroxide: will do
20:34 #spi: < Hydroxide> cool
20:34 #spi: < schultmc> bdale: Jimmy noticed that we're partially in the NY charities records now
20:34 #spi: < schultmc> so they're processing our forms
20:34 #spi: < bdale> oh, that's an interesting point .. yes .. seems like fees should be amortized unless it's something we're forgetting
20:35 #spi: < bdale> yes, great, I'm pleased to know they at least received the stuff from us
20:35 #spi: < bdale> ok, anything else?
20:35 #spi: < Hydroxide> http://bartlett.ag.ny.gov/Char_Forms/show_details.jsp?id={CA400437-19FD-44C5-8A10-AD5132D7A2CF} is our partial record there, presumably still being processed

20:37 #spi: < bdale> [item 7, Items up for discussion]
20:37 #spi: < bdale> None.
20:37 #spi: < bdale> [item 8, Any other business]
20:37 #spi: < bdale> Do any board members have other items for discussion they would like to address briefly?
20:37 #spi: < bdale> zobel?
20:38 #spi: < zobel> well, as we did not hear back from debian.eu domain holder, zack asked if someone his common with the ADR process
20:38 #spi: < zobel> i guess not
20:38 #spi: < bdale> outside my experience
20:38 #spi: < zobel> zack == currently DPL
20:39 #spi: < zobel> for those not common with Debian
20:39 #spi: < bdale> let's continue this on the lists, I guess, working out an answer for zack and proceeding on behalf of Debian to take the next step is probably best not handled here today
20:39 #spi: < zobel> i would give it a complete other try. i could try to give them a phone call next week, if noone minds.
20:39 #spi: < bdale> anyone have anything else?
20:39 #spi: < cdlu> not me
20:39 #spi: < Hydroxide> me either
20:39 #spi: < Noodles> Nor me.
20:40 #spi: < Ganneff> we are too fast. bdale wanted 30 mins
20:40 #spi: < Noodles> We can provide him an extra 20 minutes some other time.
20:40 #spi: < Hydroxide> haha
20:40 #spi: < bdale> pfft
20:40 #spi: < zobel> bdale: give Ganneff 20min talk time :)
20:40 #spi: < bdale> [item 9, Next board meeting]
20:40 #spi: < bdale> Our next regularly-scheduled monthly meeting will be February 9th, 2010, 20:30 UTC. 
20:40 #spi: < bdale> Any strong objections?
20:40 #spi: < Hydroxide> cdlu's rule is in tatters :)
20:40 #spi:  * bdale ^5's Hydroxide 
20:40 #spi:  * Hydroxide does not mind that time/date
20:40 #spi: < cdlu> hahahaha
20:41 #spi: < bdale> it's after FOSDEM, so should be ok for me
20:41 #spi: < bdale> Ok, thank you to everyone present for participating today.

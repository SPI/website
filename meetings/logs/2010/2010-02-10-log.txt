20:02 #spi: < bdale> [item 1, Opening] Welcome to today's Software in the Public Interest board of directors meeting, which is now called to order.

20:02 #spi: < bdale> [item 2, Roll Call]

20:02 #spi: < bdale> Guests (including board advisors), please /msg your names to Noodles if you wish your attendance to be recorded in the minutes of this meeting.
20:02 #spi: < schultmc_> Michael Schultheiss
20:02 #spi: < bdale> Bdale Garbee
20:02 #spi: < Hydroxide> Jimmy Kaplowitz
20:02 #spi: < Noodles> Jonathan McDowell
20:03 #spi: < bdale> we had some regrets, right?
20:03 #spi: < Hydroxide> yes
20:03 #spi:  * Hydroxide will /msg cdlu and luk__
20:03 #spi: < Hydroxide> done
20:04 #spi: < Hydroxide> bdale: 3 regrets, so everyone else needs to show
20:04 #spi: < Noodles> As above, regrets have been received from Joerg Jaspert, Joshua D. Drake and Martin Zobel-Helas.
20:04 #spi: < Hydroxide> the time change might have confused people - it certainly confused me and an earlier version of /topic
20:04 #spi: < bdale> indeed
20:05 #spi: < bdale> fortunately, we only have one set of minutes and no other known business, so if we fail to make quorum today it's not the end of the world
20:05 #spi: < Hydroxide> the emails did have the right time in the body, though no time at all in the subject
20:05 #spi: < Hydroxide> bdale: indeed - can certainly wait until next month if necessary
20:05 #spi: < Hydroxide> or whenever this meeting gets rescheduled to, if people want to hold it still
20:05 #spi: < Noodles> Would times in the subject be helpful? That's easy to do.
20:05 #spi: < Hydroxide> Noodles: yes
20:06 #spi:  * bdale proposed we stay until :15 and give up if we haven't met quorum by then
20:06 #spi: < Noodles> Ok, will add.
20:06 #spi: < bdale> proposes, even
20:06 #spi: < Hydroxide> Noodles: and maybe a mention in the body when it's different from the previous month, though if that's too much of an administrative burden then it's not essential
20:06 #spi: < Hydroxide> bdale: sounds good
20:06 #spi: < Noodles> I didn't mention this month because it was the "usual" time; I did explicitly mention it was an hour later last month.
20:06 #spi: < Hydroxide> ...ah
20:06 #spi: < Hydroxide> right, I hadn't thought about that
20:06 #spi: < Hydroxide> I'm also confused by having debconf meetings at 21:00 UTC :) that said, I did make it here
20:07 #spi: < schultmc_> I briefly put the wrong time in the topic but hopefully that brief error wasn't taken as authoritative
20:07 #spi: < Hydroxide> hopefully
20:08 #spi: < Hydroxide> also hopefully, everyone here will have read last month's minutes before our next meeting :)
20:08 #spi: < cdlu> David Graham
20:08 #spi: < cdlu> sorry!
20:09 #spi: < bdale> cdlu: thanks.  now I think we're still one shy.
20:09 #spi: < cdlu> I'm getting my times all mixed up again, thought it was at 4 local :)
20:09 #spi: < Hydroxide> hi cdlu ... one more person (luk__) and we can do it!
20:09 #spi:  * cdlu is at work so may be sporadic
20:09 #spi: < bdale> cdlu: s'ok, I was caught by surprise too
20:09 #spi: < Hydroxide> same
20:09 #spi: < bdale> cdlu: we have one set of minutes to approve today and no other known business
20:09 #spi: < cdlu> k
20:10 #spi: < bdale> cdlu: I've proposed we try for quorum until :15 then defer until next month
20:10 #spi: < Hydroxide> anyone able to call luk__ conveniently, please do so
20:10 #spi: < bdale> I tried a /msg too, but that obviously doesn't work if he's afk
20:10 #spi: < cdlu> I was partially present in January. Can I give a partial yes vote? :)
20:10 #spi: < Hydroxide> bdale: quite
20:11 #spi: < cdlu> no useful info on his facebook profile to reach him
20:11 #spi: < bdale> cdlu: I'm pretty sure we counted your votes
20:11 #spi: < bdale> confirmed in minutes
20:11 #spi: < Noodles> I wasn't sure about that.
20:11 #spi: < cdlu> ya, but I got a partial present (which is accurate, I wasn't actually here)
20:11 #spi: < Noodles> You disappeared mid meeting, but voted for everything.
20:11 #spi: < cdlu> so I was offering a partial yes vote to approve the minutes :)
20:12 #spi: < Noodles> Ah, ok. You weren't disputing my marking of you as that.
20:12 #spi: < cdlu> nope not at all
20:12 #spi:  * cdlu is not a very disputing type
20:13 #spi:  * Hydroxide is tempted to dispute that for humor's sake
20:15 #spi: < schultmc_> luk__ has a phone number in db.d.o if anyone has international calling capabilities
20:15 #spi: < bdale> Ok, it's 15 minutes past the hour and we have failed to make quorum.  Given the lack of time critical business, let's just try again next month.
20:15 #spi: < bdale> Our next regularly-scheduled monthly meeting will be March 10th at 20:00 UTC.
20:15 #spi: < bdale> Any strong objections?
20:15 #spi: < Noodles> Given that there's not much for this month, not from me.
20:15 #spi: < schultmc_> no objections here
20:15 #spi: < Hydroxide> ok
20:15 #spi: < Noodles> I'll make sure to include the time in the subject of the emails.
20:15 #spi: < bdale> Ok, then thank you to everyone present for participating today.
20:15 #spi: < bdale> *GAVEL*

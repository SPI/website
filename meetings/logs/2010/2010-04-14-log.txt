21:08 #spi: < schultmc> standard report is in the agenda
21:08 #spi: < Ganneff> any extra? anyone with questions?
21:08 #spi: < schultmc> click and pledge has changed our account setup so we now get ACH direct deposits of donations 2-3 days after they're donated rather than waiting for a check once per month
21:08 #spi: < Hydroxide> yay! :)
21:08 #spi: < Ganneff> greagt
21:09 #spi: < schultmc> we'll still get 1-2 more checks but donations will primarily be deposited much faster
21:09 #spi: < Noodles> It's nice to see some activity from Yafaray, as a new project.
21:09 #spi: < schultmc> </done>
21:09 #spi: < Hydroxide> Noodles: agreed
21:09 #spi: < Hydroxide> schultmc: I guess that make their data easier to integrate into treasurer's reports?
21:09 #spi: < schultmc> Hydroxide: no harder or easier than present
21:10 #spi: < Ganneff> ok. anything else in treasurer section?
21:10 #spi: < schultmc> nope, hence my </done>
21:10 #spi: < Ganneff> not from you, yeah :)
21:10 #spi: < Ganneff> [item 7, Any other business]
21:10 #spi: < Ganneff> one minute, speak up. :)
21:10 #spi: < Noodles> Please reply to my most recent mail on -board. ;)
21:10 #spi: < Noodles> (that wasn't a meeting reminder)
21:10 #spi: < Ganneff> oh. yu send something else? wow. :)
21:11 #spi: < Noodles> Huh.
21:11 #spi: < cdlu> Noodles, I don't believe we have any precedent to grant money to projects that are not member projects
21:11 #spi: < Hydroxide> the one from the 11th?
21:11 #spi: < cdlu> however our projects are free to do so with their money.
21:11 #spi: < Noodles> Yes.
21:11 #spi:  * Hydroxide agrees with cdlu
21:11 #spi: < Noodles> cdlu: Right, that's how I see it.
21:11 #spi: < cdlu> if they'd like to apply to be an associated project
21:11 #spi: < cdlu> and raise money that we hold on to
21:11 #spi: < cdlu> they're welcome to do that
21:11 #spi: < Noodles> As long as that's how others see it I can reply and say as much.
21:12 #spi: < cdlu> anyone see it differently?
21:12 #spi: < luk__> nope
21:12 #spi: < Ganneff> no
21:12 #spi: < Ganneff> ok. anyone else?
21:12 #spi: < Ganneff> we are too slow :)
21:12 #spi: < cdlu> yes
21:13 #spi: < Ganneff> cdlu: fine. go.
21:13 #spi: < cdlu> Ganneff, just a reminder that the election is coming up soon

21:13 #spi: < Noodles> I need to talk to Maulkin to learn vote stuff.

21:16 #spi: < Hydroxide> sounds like we've reached consensus on may 19
21:16 #spi: < Noodles> I can do May 19th if that works better for everyone.

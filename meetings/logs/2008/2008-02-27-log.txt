19:08 < Ganneff> We have on item here, "Decision on new board member". Someone want to take the floor?
19:08 < Maulkin> (agliodbs: catchup :P)
19:08 < Maulkin> Ganneff: you're the chair :)
19:08  * schultmc has one more item for treasurer report
19:08 < cdlu> I move that xzilla and hydroxide be put up as separate motions
19:08 < cdlu> in either order
19:08 < Ganneff> schultmc: after this point.
19:08 < schultmc> k
19:09 < Hydroxide> cdlu: does that mean we might both get appointed?
19:09 < Ganneff> i second cdlus suggestion
19:09 < cdlu> hydroxide, if that is the board's will
19:09 < Hydroxide> ok
19:09 < cdlu> I don't have a problem with it, as long as both commit to attending all meetings from now until election -- also gives us our third seat for election.
19:09 < cdlu> if that's the outcome.
19:10 < cdlu> xzilla's almost 10K minutes idle though. :)
19:10 < cdlu> ganneff, you seconded it, you can put it to a vote :)
19:10 < Maulkin> Hang on...
19:10 < cdlu> 'k
19:10 < Ganneff> what to vote on? that we decide on them in seperate order?
19:10 < Ganneff> fine, vote! :)
19:10 < Maulkin> xzilla: hurry up... :)
19:10 < cdlu> ganneff, no on each one :)
19:10 < Maulkin> Hydroxide first, or xzilla?
19:11 < Ganneff> Hydroxide, he is here. :)
19:11 < cdlu> it matters not.
19:11 < Maulkin> Voting started, 6 people (cdlu,ganneff,schultmc,luk,maulkin,agliodbs) allowed to vote on Appoint Jimmy Kaplowitz to board until next board elections. - You may vote yes/no/abstain only, type !vote $yourchoice now.

19:11 < Ganneff> !vote yes
19:11 < schultmc> !vote yes
19:11 < Maulkin> !vote yes
19:11 < luk> !vote yes
19:11 < Maulkin> agliodbs?
19:12 < Ganneff> he made quorum and then ran away :)
19:12 < Maulkin> .oO(This makes quorum requirements... interesting)
19:12 < Ganneff> but as its clear even if he votes no - go on, i would say.
19:12 < agliodbs> sorry
19:12 < agliodbs> on phone, got the meeting time wrong
19:12 < agliodbs> yes
19:12 < agliodbs> !vote yes
19:13 < Maulkin> (for minutes, or Hydroxide?)
19:13  * Maulkin assumes Hydroxide 
19:13 < Ganneff> assume the running vote, as your script does.
19:13 < agliodbs> Hydroxide is the current vote
19:13 < Maulkin> Current voting results for "Appoint Jimmy Kaplowitz to board until next board elections": Yes: 6, No: 0, Abstain: 0, Missing: 0 ()
19:13 < Maulkin> Voting for "Appoint Jimmy Kaplowitz to board until next board elections" closed.
19:13 < cdlu> I move that we accept Jimmy's position immediately and accept Josh's resignation simultaneously with our thanks for his years of service, allowing hydroxide to join the board immediately without affecting our quorum.
19:13  * Maulkin seconds
19:13 < Ganneff> does that mean "within this meeting"?
19:13  * schultmc secodns
19:13 < cdlu> yes, right this second, if there's consent.
19:14 < schultmc> err seconds
19:14 < Maulkin> Voting started, 6 people (cdlu,ganneff,schultmc,luk,maulkin,agliodbs) allowed to vote on What cdlu said. - You may vote yes/no/abstain only, type !vote $yourchoice now.
19:14 < cdlu> !vote yes
19:14 < Ganneff> intresting, the first approved candidate could vote no to the second
19:14 < luk> Ganneff: no
19:14 < cdlu> ganneff, they could
19:14 < Ganneff> luk: yes.
19:14 < luk> of course not during the meeting
19:14 < Maulkin> !vote yes
19:14 < Ganneff> !vote abstain
19:14 < Ganneff> luk: yes, thats what they propose
19:14 < luk> !vote abstain
19:14 < Maulkin> Hydroxide: I expect you to abstain :)
19:14 < schultmc> !vote yes
19:14 < cdlu> hydroxide can't vote yet :)
19:14 < Hydroxide> Maulkin: I was just typing that I would abstain :)
19:14 < cdlu> until the vote passes. I love it. :)
19:15 < Hydroxide> Maulkin: I mean, I'm not voting on this vote
19:15 < Ganneff> cdlu: no, but on xzilla he could
19:15 < cdlu> yes
19:15 < Hydroxide> Maulkin: I'm going to abstain on xzilla in the interest of fairness
19:15 < Maulkin> Hydroxide: ack.
19:15  * Ganneff would have taken both into vote first, and then replaced josh. but meh, i abstained
19:15 < Hydroxide> though I will state for the record that I have no problem with him being on the board if the other board members decide they want to deal with the higher quorum requirement
19:15 < cdlu> I'm going to vote no on xzilla simply because he's not here and that is in contravention of my one condition for having both appointed. I encourage him to run in July.
19:15 < Maulkin> Need one more for quorum here. agliodbs?
19:16 < cdlu> maulkin, quorum rules require quorum of attendance, not quorum on votes.
19:16 < Hydroxide> cdlu: very good point. he does need to show up if he wants to be on the board :)
19:16 < agliodbs> that's not a vote
19:16 < Maulkin> cdlu: Does it?
19:16 < cdlu> agliodbs, ?
19:16 < cdlu> maulkin, I believe so. our by-laws *are* weird. :)
19:16 < Hydroxide> agliodbs: I think they're voting on making my appointment to the board take effect right now instead of after the meeting
19:16 < agliodbs> oh, ok
19:17 < agliodbs> !vote yes
19:17 < Hydroxide> agliodbs: which would also make your resignation effective right now
19:17 < cdlu> agliodbs, which leaves you free to not stick around :)
19:17 < Maulkin> Current voting results for "What cdlu said": Yes: 4, No: 0, Abstain: 2, Missing: 0 ()
19:17 < Maulkin> Voting for "What cdlu said" closed.
19:17 < agliodbs> which then makes this my last vote
19:17 < cdlu> yes
19:17  * Maulkin thanks agliodbs
19:17 < cdlu> agliodbs, thanks for your years of service on the board, as treasurer and general help
19:17 < Ganneff> yes. thanks agliodbs for being on board and doing work for spi

19:18 < Ganneff> !vote no
19:18 < Maulkin> Forced vote no on hydrox
19:18 < Maulkin> Forced vote abstain on hydrox
19:18 < Maulkin> That's better
19:19 < Maulkin> missing luk
19:19 < Hydroxide> Maulkin: no need to force the vote - I did correctly abstain
19:19 < cdlu> hydroxide, bot doesn't know you.
19:19 < Ganneff> Hydroxide: he hasnt set your nick to vote

19:20 < Ganneff> Maulkin: assume abstain to luk anbd go on? wont change the result.

20:00 < Overfiend> Branden Robinson
20:00 < jberkus> Josh Berkus
20:00 < Diziet> Ian Jackson
20:00 < Hydroxide> Jimmy Kaplowitz
20:00 < bdale-gprs> Bdale Garbee
20:00 < cdlu> all guests to this meeting, including advisors, please /msg me your name for the record.
20:00 < cdlu> David Graham
20:00 < Overfiend> <Joey> Joey
20:00 < cdlu> and of course <Joey> Martin Schulze
20:00 < cdlu> that's 9 out of 9
20:00 < jberkus> xzilla: you're an Adivsor
20:00 < cdlu> congratulations everyone
20:01 < jberkus> xzilla == Robert Treat
20:01 < cdlu> first up: there is precisely one nomination per available officer role.
20:01 < Hydroxide> xzilla: greetings. that was quite the stealthmode there :)
20:01 < Diziet> Am I being obtuse or is the agenda not up on the web ?
20:01 < cdlu> Diziet, only to spi-board/-private list
20:01 < Hydroxide> Diziet: it was emailed out, but it consists exactly of uncontested officer elections and nothing else
20:01 < jberkus> guests include linuxpoet (Josh Drake) and G_SabinoMullane (Greg Sabino-Mullane)
20:02 < Diziet> cdlu: Fine.
20:02 < cdlu> I therefore move the following: that all four candidates for board positions currently listed be appointed to these officer roles for the 2006-2007 fiscal year
20:02  * Joey would like to rais a concern that 3/4 candidates for the top four positions are new members on the board with no former or only very little former board experience.
20:02 < cdlu> any discussion before we vote?
20:02 < Diziet> (I've got the mail here in front of me.)
20:02 < Hydroxide> cdlu: might want to state the names and positions in the meeting
20:02 < cdlu> jberkus, I have a long list of guests who have messaged me, including those.
20:02 < Hydroxide> cdlu: just for the record, since there's no agenda on a website
20:02 < bdale-gprs> Joey, at least one has an excellant meeting attendance record, though
20:02 < jberkus> cdlu: oh, ok
20:02 < cdlu> sure.
20:02 < Diziet> Can I move that we formally accept the elected board members onto the board ?
20:03 < Hydroxide> Diziet: it was automatic as part of the election resolution
20:03 < cdlu> the names are: Bdale Garbee for President, Michael Schultheiss for Vice President, Neil McGovern for Secretary, and Josh Berkus for Treasurer
20:03 < Overfiend> Is that necessary under the bylaws>?
20:03 < Diziet> IIRC the bylaws are still confused about whether we're elected or appointed.
20:03 < Diziet> Hydroxide: Yes, but I just want to dot the I and cross the T.
20:03 < Joey> Diziet: err... that's what the election was all about, no?
20:03 < Hydroxide> Diziet: I think the election resolution automatically appointed the winners of the election without further ado
20:03 < cdlu> Diziet, no need, they're automatically appointed by the 2004 election resolution
20:03 < Hydroxide> Diziet: and, it's out of order anyway. this is a special meeting with restricted agenda
20:03 < Overfiend> Put it this way...
20:03 < Overfiend> Does anyone here object to the seating of the new Board members per the election results?
20:04 < cdlu> I don't.
20:04 < Overfiend> sorry to continue the o-o-oness
20:04  * Hydroxide seconds cdlu's motion to approve all the officers
20:04 < Overfiend> but that might be a good way of slaying it.
20:04  * Hydroxide is ready to vote
20:04 < cdlu> we have a seconded motion
20:04 < cdlu> shall we vote? if you disagree, this is your chance to vote no.
20:04 < Joey> I gather that nobody else is interested in one of the four board positions.
20:04 < cdlu> On the motion stated before to make the above named have the above mentionned officer roles: please vote yes/no/abstain.
20:04 < Overfiend> or if someone else would like to stand for an office.
20:04 < Maulkin> Joey: correct
20:04 < Hydroxide> Joey: correct.
20:04 < cdlu> Joey, the request for nominations has been out for three weeks.
20:04 < Overfiend> !vote yes
20:05 < cdlu> !vote yes
20:05 < schultmc> !vote yes
20:05 < Maulkin> !vote yes
20:05  * Joey votes yes
20:05 < Hydroxide> !vote yes
20:05 < Diziet> !vote yes
20:05 < jberkus> !vote yes
20:05 < bdale-gprs> !vote yes
20:05 < Diziet> Joey: I did consider standing for Secretary but I decided that I wouldn't have the time to give it enough attention.
20:05 < cdlu> yes: 8, no: 0, abstain: 0, missing: one?
20:05 < Joey> (:me is not happy though...  Hopefully it'll be good)
20:05 < cdlu> who am I missing?
20:05 < Overfiend> I see 9 yes votes.
20:05 < Hydroxide> that's 9 of 9, right? or am I miscounting?
20:05 < cdlu> you're right
20:05 < linuxpoet> I see 9
20:05 < cdlu> it is passed unanimously
20:05 < bdale-gprs> cdlu, you counted Joey?
20:05 < Hydroxide> great
20:05 < cdlu> congratulations officers, you are now in office.
20:06 < Overfiend> can't ask for a better start than that.
20:06 < Maulkin> gavel? :)
20:06 < cdlu> and that concludes this meeting
20:06  * cdlu pounds the gavel

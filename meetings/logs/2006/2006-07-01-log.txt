Sat Jul  1 15:00:38 2006 | <CosmicRay> John Goerzen
Sat Jul  1 15:00:45 2006 | <Hydroxide> ...and now we wait
Sat Jul  1 15:00:54 2006 | <CosmicRay> this *stinks*
Sat Jul  1 15:00:58 2006 | <Hydroxide> quite
Sat Jul  1 15:01:17 2006 | <Hydroxide> well, let's see if people arrive late
Sat Jul  1 15:01:20 2006 | <Hydroxide> (up to a point)
Sat Jul  1 15:01:21 2006 | * Maulkin plays musak
Sat Jul  1 15:01:25 2006 | <cdlu> I just pinged joey, mako, bdale
Sat Jul  1 15:01:32 2006 | <cdlu> and overfiend
Sat Jul  1 15:01:39 2006 | <CosmicRay> I jist pinged overfiend and mako.
Sat Jul  1 15:01:47 2006 | <cdlu> musak?
Sat Jul  1 15:01:56 2006 | <CosmicRay> well folks
Sat Jul  1 15:02:08 2006 | <CosmicRay> it looks like we have failed to make board quorum for the annual meeting
Sat Jul  1 15:02:20 2006 | <Maulkin> cdlu: The sort of music you get in supermarkets and lifts
Sat Jul  1 15:02:20 2006 | <CosmicRay> let's give it a couple of minutes but I guess we should come up with a date to try again
Sat Jul  1 15:02:54 2006 | * cdlu sighs
Sat Jul  1 15:03:10 2006 | <cdlu> my wife just left 5 minutes ago for something I did not go to to attend this.
Sat Jul  1 15:03:14 2006 | <cdlu> with the car
Sat Jul  1 15:03:17 2006 | <CosmicRay> sigh.
Sat Jul  1 15:03:24 2006 | <cdlu> (a friend's wedding, no less)
Sat Jul  1 15:03:36 2006 | <CosmicRay> sigh!
Sat Jul  1 15:03:47 2006 | <CosmicRay> cdlu: I guess we need to postpone.
Sat Jul  1 15:03:55 2006 | <cdlu> CosmicRay, one sec..
Sat Jul  1 15:03:56 2006 | <Hydroxide> it's still only 3 minutes in
Sat Jul  1 15:04:17 2006 | <cdlu> heh..
Sat Jul  1 15:04:22 2006 | <CosmicRay> Hydroxide: I don't mind waiting longer if y'all don't.  otoh, we have only 3 board members here.
Sat Jul  1 15:04:33 2006 | <cdlu> the only board member we have probably cause to fire under our attendance policy is mako, interestingly.
Sat Jul  1 15:04:39 2006 | <cdlu> he's up for election now anyway. :)
Sat Jul  1 15:05:03 2006 | <cdlu> I don't mind waiting a few more minutes but on a holiday weekend I doubt we'll see many people
Sat Jul  1 15:05:03 2006 | <Hydroxide> and even if we could somehow fire him without quorum, it wouldn't change the quorum
Sat Jul  1 15:05:12 2006 | <cdlu> nope.
Sat Jul  1 15:05:15 2006 | <Hydroxide> cdlu: it's not a holiday weekend for Joey
Sat Jul  1 15:05:21 2006 | <CosmicRay> or ian
Sat Jul  1 15:05:26 2006 | <cdlu> Hydroxide, it's *always* a holiday weekend for joey and ian.
Sat Jul  1 15:05:31 2006 | <cdlu> even on tuesdays.
Sat Jul  1 15:05:32 2006 | <CosmicRay> hah
Sat Jul  1 15:05:37 2006 | <Hydroxide> or for any US people who have to work Monday (such as my father)
Sat Jul  1 15:06:08 2006 | * cdlu grumbles
Sat Jul  1 15:06:28 2006 | <cdlu> well, CosmicRay, we can still make announcements and dance in circles around a fire pit without quorum
Sat Jul  1 15:06:33 2006 | <cdlu> we just can't 'conduct business'
Sat Jul  1 15:06:51 2006 | <CosmicRay> heh
Sat Jul  1 15:07:02 2006 | <CosmicRay> we don't have a treasurer's report yet, so there is no annual report yet.
Sat Jul  1 15:07:10 2006 | <cdlu> schultmc, congratulations, your nomination is the only one posted. you are the frontrunner in the election. :)
Sat Jul  1 15:07:13 2006 | * schultmc_ would like to know when the annual meeting will be rescheduled - a post to -general would be fine
Sat Jul  1 15:07:15 2006 | <schultmc_> heh
Sat Jul  1 15:07:16 2006 | <schultmc_> w00t
Sat Jul  1 15:07:27 2006 | <cdlu> CR, any objections to my proposed date?
Sat Jul  1 15:07:31 2006 | <CosmicRay> schultmc: at this rate, you may be president before the annual meeting happens ;-)
Sat Jul  1 15:07:35 2006 | <CosmicRay> cdlu: none
Sat Jul  1 15:07:36 2006 | <schultmc_> hah
Sat Jul  1 15:07:43 2006 | <Hydroxide> would we be able to do the 18th?
Sat Jul  1 15:07:44 2006 | <schultmc_> what's the propsed date?
Sat Jul  1 15:07:47 2006 | <cdlu>  ok, the by-laws allows a 'lesser number' to adjourn
Sat Jul  1 15:07:47 2006 | * schultmc_ got here late
Sat Jul  1 15:07:50 2006 | <Hydroxide> or is that too far for our bylaws to allow?
Sat Jul  1 15:07:52 2006 | <cdlu> Hydroxide, I can't do it the 18th
Sat Jul  1 15:07:54 2006 | <CosmicRay> cdlu was talking july 11
Sat Jul  1 15:07:56 2006 | <cdlu> and the limit is 14 days
Sat Jul  1 15:07:57 2006 | <Hydroxide> ah
Sat Jul  1 15:08:01 2006 | <Maulkin> cdlu: Nominations only opened today! :)
Sat Jul  1 15:08:08 2006 | <Hydroxide> I was just thinking of our normal meeting time, but never mind then
Sat Jul  1 15:08:11 2006 | <cdlu> Maulkin, well, he's still the frontrunner :)
Sat Jul  1 15:08:30 2006 | <Maulkin> cdlu: Point :)
Sat Jul  1 15:09:08 2006 | <CosmicRay> I intend to resign as president at the end of my current term (which is this year), btw.
Sat Jul  1 15:09:31 2006 | <cdlu> CR, in other words you do not intend to re-run for president. :)
Sat Jul  1 15:09:32 2006 | <Maulkin> ...
Sat Jul  1 15:09:48 2006 | <Maulkin> Is anyone on the board actually staying? :)
Sat Jul  1 15:09:58 2006 | <cdlu> jberkus, I want your nomination :)
Sat Jul  1 15:10:02 2006 | <CosmicRay> ok, let's say july 11 since it seems to be OK with everone
Sat Jul  1 15:10:08 2006 | <CosmicRay> jberkus: we failed to meet quorum today.
Sat Jul  1 15:10:09 2006 | <CosmicRay> sigh.
Sat Jul  1 15:10:13 2006 | <jberkus> aieee
Sat Jul  1 15:10:17 2006 | <cdlu> by a mile. we made 3/6/9 :)
Sat Jul  1 15:10:19 2006 | <Hydroxide> I'm staying on as board member, but not as treasurer
Sat Jul  1 15:10:21 2006 | <schultmc_> cool - the 11th works better for me
Sat Jul  1 15:10:25 2006 | <jberkus> well, it *is* July 4th weekend
Sat Jul  1 15:10:31 2006 | <cdlu> I'm staying on as a board member one more year, but not as secretary :)
Sat Jul  1 15:10:31 2006 | * schultmc_ has stuff to to on weekends
Sat Jul  1 15:10:35 2006 | <jberkus> I'm currently on dial-up from Southern Oregon
Sat Jul  1 15:10:35 2006 | <CosmicRay> This semi-formal gathering is adjourned until july 11 at 19:00 UTC then.  *gavel*

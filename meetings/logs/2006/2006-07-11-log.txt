Tue Jul 11 15:02:34 2006 | <mako> *GAVEL*
Tue Jul 11 15:02:35 2006 | * cdlu draws to the attention of the board the presence of the press
Tue Jul 11 15:02:46 2006 | <cdlu> David Graham
Tue Jul 11 15:02:50 2006 | <mako> cdlu: which press?
Tue Jul 11 15:02:52 2006 | <Hydroxide> Jimmy Kaplowitz
Tue Jul 11 15:02:56 2006 | <Overfiend> Branden Robinson
Tue Jul 11 15:02:59 2006 | <bdale> Bdale Garbee
Tue Jul 11 15:03:01 2006 | <cdlu> board members, please identify yourselves in channel, guests, please /msg me your names for the record.
Tue Jul 11 15:03:12 2006 | <mako> cdlu: beat me to it
Tue Jul 11 15:03:15 2006 | <mako> Benjamin Mako Hill
Tue Jul 11 15:03:23 2006 | <cdlu> mako, jzb and TechJournalist (who seems to have timed out)
Tue Jul 11 15:03:37 2006 | <mako> ah, greetings to both, thanks for coming
Tue Jul 11 15:03:40 2006 | <Overfiend> jzb as in Zonker?
Tue Jul 11 15:03:53 2006 | <jzb> Overfiend: yes
Tue Jul 11 15:03:57 2006 | <Overfiend> jzb: howdy!
Tue Jul 11 15:04:11 2006 | <Hydroxide> (<Joey> Martin "Joey" Schulze)
Tue Jul 11 15:04:26 2006 | <jzb> Howdy Overfiend!
Tue Jul 11 15:04:27 2006 | <Hydroxide> (he joined and was speaking right before the meeting started)
Tue Jul 11 15:04:44 2006 | <mako> great.. quorate and everything
Tue Jul 11 15:04:57 2006 | <mako> hopefully, we'll have another board member or two join us at some point in the middle
Tue Jul 11 15:05:25 2006 | <mako> might as well start from the top
Tue Jul 11 15:05:38 2006 | <mako> 3. President's report (John Goerzen)
Tue Jul 11 15:05:43 2006 | <Overfiend> Hmmm.
Tue Jul 11 15:05:45 2006 | <cdlu> the agenda is at http://www.spi-inc.org/secretary/agenda/2006-07-01.html if you want to follow along
Tue Jul 11 15:06:02 2006 | <Overfiend> how about I call John's phone
Tue Jul 11 15:06:31 2006 | <mako> right, we have no president
Tue Jul 11 15:06:39 2006 | <Overfiend> wow, what an odd sounding ring
Tue Jul 11 15:06:42 2006 | <cdlu> I SMS'd him 10 minutes ago
Tue Jul 11 15:06:44 2006 | <Overfiend> must be Asterisk
Tue Jul 11 15:06:46 2006 | <Overfiend> cdlu: I know
Tue Jul 11 15:07:13 2006 | <Overfiend> left voice mail
Tue Jul 11 15:07:30 2006 | <cdlu> mako, might as well keep going. That's what we have a vp for. :)
Tue Jul 11 15:07:33 2006 | * Overfiend proposes moving on to the next item
Tue Jul 11 15:07:42 2006 | <mako> right
Tue Jul 11 15:07:52 2006 | <mako> Hydroxide
Tue Jul 11 15:07:57 2006 | <Hydroxide> An update that was current on the Treasurer's report situation as of July 1st is in the agenda. Since then, my computer problems are fixed but I haven't yet gotten to catching up on the Treasurer's reports. Still, what I say in that update about my plans to catch up by the election cycle switchover on July 29 is still true. I apologize for the delays.
Tue Jul 11 15:08:26 2006 | * mako nods
Tue Jul 11 15:08:37 2006 | <mako> CosmicRay: hey there! :)
Tue Jul 11 15:08:38 2006 | <cdlu> CosmicRay, we're on Treasurer's Report
Tue Jul 11 15:08:44 2006 | <Hydroxide> (I have been doing some SPI stuff in the meantime, as is reflected via board@ email as well as the other updates I have on other items in the agenda)
Tue Jul 11 15:08:50 2006 | <CosmicRay> hey all, sorry I'm late (was in a meeting that ran late)
Tue Jul 11 15:08:51 2006 | <Hydroxide> (so I'm not a total slacker ;P)
Tue Jul 11 15:09:02 2006 | <Hydroxide> CosmicRay: any president's report for today?
Tue Jul 11 15:09:09 2006 | <Joey> Great, we all appreciate that.
Tue Jul 11 15:09:14 2006 | <mako> CosmicRay: it's fine, feel free to get caught up on and then i'm happy to pass the reigns back to you
Tue Jul 11 15:09:18 2006 | <CosmicRay> give me a minute to find my notes
Tue Jul 11 15:09:21 2006 | <mako> Hydroxide: yes, i'm looking forward to that
Tue Jul 11 15:09:24 2006 | <mako> CosmicRay: yes, take your time
Tue Jul 11 15:09:41 2006 | <Overfiend> should we entertain question for Jimmy while John prepares?
Tue Jul 11 15:09:44 2006 | <mako> that's fine
Tue Jul 11 15:09:48 2006 | <Overfiend> questions, that is
Tue Jul 11 15:09:52 2006 | <Hydroxide> if anyone has questions, sure.
Tue Jul 11 15:10:12 2006 | <Overfiend> okay, I have one. :)
Tue Jul 11 15:10:15 2006 | <Hydroxide> ok
Tue Jul 11 15:10:28 2006 | * bdale continues to be frustrated that we aren't up to date on treasury reports, but acknowledges and appreciates progress
Tue Jul 11 15:10:30 2006 | <Overfiend> Hydroxide: is there anything you need from me aside from the stuff we've discussed earlier, chasing up the MBS status?
Tue Jul 11 15:10:47 2006 | <Overfiend> Hydroxide: namely, can you take care of the lower-urgency PostgreSQL disbursements?
Tue Jul 11 15:10:51 2006 | <cdlu> bdale, also note that this is the last meeting with the current treasurer serving in that capacity. Same applies to all the other officers, if previous statements stand.
Tue Jul 11 15:10:53 2006 | <Hydroxide> Overfiend: sure
Tue Jul 11 15:11:27 2006 | <bdale> cdlu: understood.  presume we'll be voting on new officers at next board meeting if election proceeds on schedule
Tue Jul 11 15:11:29 2006 | <Overfiend> Hmm, I guess my role as Deputy Treasurer would evaporate along with Jimmy's term in office
Tue Jul 11 15:11:36 2006 | <bdale> Overfiend: yes, I think so
Tue Jul 11 15:11:38 2006 | <cdlu> bdale, we should be, in August.
Tue Jul 11 15:11:48 2006 | <CosmicRay> OK, my notes are out in the ether somewhere.  the president's update is basically that I received only one contribution for the annual report (from the membership committee, I believe).  So, due to the lack of information (especially a treasurer's report), it was not possible to assemble an annual report this year.
Tue Jul 11 15:11:58 2006 | <bdale> Overfiend: obviously new treasurer would be free to similarly solicit help
Tue Jul 11 15:12:04 2006 | <Hydroxide> Overfiend: there also needs to be a form 8868 filed to extend our IRS filing deadline until November 15 since we're right now in the middle of an elections cycle and PostgreSQL conference
Tue Jul 11 15:12:22 2006 | <Hydroxide> Overfiend: (both of which include our probable next treasurer)
Tue Jul 11 15:12:25 2006 | <Overfiend> I am interested in continuing to serve as Deputy Treasurer until my services are no longer needed.  Josh Berkus and I, in a flush of optimism, have been discussing that.
Tue Jul 11 15:12:39 2006 | <bdale> :-)
Tue Jul 11 15:12:49 2006 | <Overfiend> Hydroxide: okay, this Form 8868 -- you gonna handle it, or should I add it to my list?
Tue Jul 11 15:12:56 2006 | <Hydroxide> Overfiend: if you have time to file that form, it'd be helpful so that I can focus on the reports, but if you don't have time then I should be able to find the time myself to do it.
Tue Jul 11 15:13:12 2006 | <Overfiend> I did not know you could get multiple extensions.  Oh, the privileges of corporate personhood in America.
Tue Jul 11 15:13:26 2006 | <Hydroxide> Overfiend: the second one is not automatic, but I think we have enough reasons to satisfy them.
Tue Jul 11 15:13:27 2006 | <Overfiend> Hydroxide: okay, I'll add it.  It will lower my blood pressure for all the other stuff.
Tue Jul 11 15:13:41 2006 | <Hydroxide> Overfiend: it's similarly available for individual persons too
Tue Jul 11 15:13:47 2006 | <Hydroxide> (slightly different durations)
Tue Jul 11 15:13:59 2006 | <Overfiend> Hydroxide: <JohnnyCarson> I did not know that.
Tue Jul 11 15:14:07 2006 | <Overfiend> okay, well, I'm done taking up Jimmy's time
Tue Jul 11 15:14:17 2006 | * Hydroxide is ready to move on unless there are more questions on this
Tue Jul 11 15:14:22 2006 | <mako> none from me
Tue Jul 11 15:14:51 2006 | <CosmicRay> OK.  are there questions about the brief president's report?
Tue Jul 11 15:15:07 2006 | <Overfiend> Can we expect one after Jimmy's prepped his T reports?
Tue Jul 11 15:15:10 2006 | <bdale> I wonder if we shouldn't issue a report even if it's nearly empty?
Tue Jul 11 15:15:32 2006 | <cdlu> I agree with Branden... a late President's report including the Treasurer's report would be better than only a Membership Ctte report.
Tue Jul 11 15:15:44 2006 | <CosmicRay> bdale: I would be happy to do that, or if the treasurer information comes in at some point, the new president did (as I did when Ean didn't publish a report when he was outgoing)
Tue Jul 11 15:15:51 2006 | <Overfiend> CosmicRay: I think your annual reports have been a substantive step towards increased professionalism at SPI
Tue Jul 11 15:15:57 2006 | <bdale> that would work for me, particularly if we establish a date for issuance today
Tue Jul 11 15:15:58 2006 | <mako> there may be other cttes that can write something up as well
Tue Jul 11 15:16:12 2006 | <Overfiend> I'd rather not see us stumble on that particular point, since it *seems* easy enough to keep it up.
Tue Jul 11 15:16:25 2006 | <CosmicRay> Overfiend: I agree
Tue Jul 11 15:16:37 2006 | <Overfiend> one other observation...
Tue Jul 11 15:17:03 2006 | <Overfiend> since we're not currently engaged in litigation, I'd say an annual report containing not much other than membership and treasury information is not anything to be ashamed of
Tue Jul 11 15:17:10 2006 | <Overfiend> ultimately, we are our members and our money
Tue Jul 11 15:17:19 2006 | <cdlu> true enough
Tue Jul 11 15:17:42 2006 | <CosmicRay> Overfiend: makes sense
Tue Jul 11 15:17:44 2006 | <slef> CosmicRay: Who else was asked when, JOOI?
Tue Jul 11 15:17:51 2006 | <bdale> Hydroxide/CosmicRay: so, can you guys agree on a date to have this done by?
Tue Jul 11 15:17:56 2006 | <CosmicRay> slef: I don't understand the question
Tue Jul 11 15:18:15 2006 | <Overfiend> big bold strategic visions are well and good, but an annual report that covers the home fires burning as it were, is far preferable to one that doesn't
Tue Jul 11 15:18:19 2006 | <CosmicRay> Hydroxide: when are you expecting to have treasurer stuff done?
Tue Jul 11 15:18:29 2006 | <slef> what other committees/projects were asked for submissions to the annual report when?
Tue Jul 11 15:18:31 2006 | <Overfiend> CosmicRay: I think he said by 29 July
Tue Jul 11 15:18:50 2006 | <CosmicRay> slef: I sent out a general query for all committees and projects to -general, about 3 weeks ago.
Tue Jul 11 15:18:58 2006 | <bdale> so, how about prepared for review/issuance by our next board meeting, presumed to be in Aug?
Tue Jul 11 15:19:15 2006 | <Overfiend> "Next board meeting - Tuesday, July 18th or August 15th (TBD), 2006 (John Goerzen)"
Tue Jul 11 15:19:15 2006 | <cdlu> August 15th should be our next board meeting
Tue Jul 11 15:19:18 2006 | <CosmicRay> slef: I received only the membership committee report.  In the past, I had received a summary of Debian hardware assets from Debian, but didn't this year
Tue Jul 11 15:19:19 2006 | <Overfiend> I take it we won't meet in 1 week, then?
Tue Jul 11 15:19:25 2006 | <cdlu> I don't see much point in having one next week
Tue Jul 11 15:19:31 2006 | <Overfiend> me neither
Tue Jul 11 15:19:36 2006 | <bdale> ideally, we'd look at a draft via -board email so we can sign off on it quickly at the meeting
Tue Jul 11 15:19:41 2006 | <Overfiend> just quoting the agenda
Tue Jul 11 15:19:51 2006 | <Hydroxide> btw, I'd suggest that we have a very limited-purpose special meeting on July 29 simply to elect the new set of officers, but do no other business
Tue Jul 11 15:20:01 2006 | <Hydroxide> it'll be useful to have a treasurer again as soon as possible.
Tue Jul 11 15:20:09 2006 | <Overfiend> that seems reasonable...I think...
Tue Jul 11 15:20:14 2006 | <Overfiend>      July 2006
Tue Jul 11 15:20:14 2006 | <Overfiend> Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
Tue Jul 11 15:20:14 2006 | <Overfiend>                    1
Tue Jul 11 15:20:14 2006 | <Overfiend>  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
Tue Jul 11 15:20:16 2006 | <Overfiend>  9 10 11 12 13 14 15
Tue Jul 11 15:20:20 2006 | <Overfiend> 16 17 18 19 20 21 22
Tue Jul 11 15:20:21 2006 | <Overfiend> 23 24 25 26 27 28 29
Tue Jul 11 15:20:24 2006 | <Overfiend> 30 31
Tue Jul 11 15:20:27 2006 | <Overfiend> Saturday.  Hmmm.
Tue Jul 11 15:20:30 2006 | <slef> CosmicRay: thanks for the info.  I'm not subbed to -general.
Tue Jul 11 15:20:33 2006 | <Overfiend> Saturday is often bad for some of the board.
Tue Jul 11 15:20:38 2006 | <CosmicRay> cdlu: when does my term expire?
Tue Jul 11 15:20:40 2006 | <bdale> 29th isn't easy for me, but I'll make it work if necessary
Tue Jul 11 15:20:44 2006 | <cdlu> Hydroxide, we could have it August 1st
Tue Jul 11 15:20:50 2006 | <Hydroxide> cdlu: that's another option
Tue Jul 11 15:20:52 2006 | <cdlu> CosmicRay, when the election results are annouced on the 29th
Tue Jul 11 15:21:01 2006 | <cdlu> the 29th I won't be here. Weekends are terrible for meetings, as we've seen.
Tue Jul 11 15:21:14 2006 | <Overfiend> 1 August should work for me.  Besides, that will give the 3 winners time to arrange to attend.
Tue Jul 11 15:21:27 2006 | <CosmicRay> ok.  I would not really be comfortable submitting an annual report after that date.  However, the new president would have all the information and could simply edit it together into a text file
Tue Jul 11 15:21:30 2006 | <cdlu> yeah, all four candidates should arrange to attend. one won't have to.
Tue Jul 11 15:21:44 2006 | <cdlu> CosmicRay, you can always submit it to the new president instead of to the board.
Tue Jul 11 15:21:47 2006 | <Overfiend> cdlu: well, I'm speaking in principle
Tue Jul 11 15:21:56 2006 | <Hydroxide> cdlu: which means we need to talk to Josh Berkus to make sure the conferences he's attending won't be a problem for attendance on 8/1
Tue Jul 11 15:22:06 2006 | <cdlu> the conference he's attending ends today
Tue Jul 11 15:22:10 2006 | * schultmc will be out of town July 29 - Aug 1 works better for me
Tue Jul 11 15:22:13 2006 | <cdlu> I don't know what others he's got
Tue Jul 11 15:22:17 2006 | <CosmicRay> Hydroxide: did you have an estimate of when you'll be getting the financial stuff done?
Tue Jul 11 15:22:19 2006 | <Hydroxide> cdlu: there are others.
Tue Jul 11 15:22:28 2006 | <cdlu> CR, can we defer next meeting discussion to the last item where it belongs?
Tue Jul 11 15:22:32 2006 | <Overfiend> Ganneff: how are 29 July and 1 August for you?
Tue Jul 11 15:22:40 2006 | <Overfiend> Is Neil McGovern here today?
Tue Jul 11 15:22:41 2006 | <Ganneff> ok
Tue Jul 11 15:22:50 2006 | <Overfiend> Ganneff: both of them?
Tue Jul 11 15:22:51 2006 | * Ganneff points at Maulkin
Tue Jul 11 15:22:51 2006 | <Hydroxide> CosmicRay: I did say by 29 July, since that's when the board member switchover happens (even though I'll still be a director)
Tue Jul 11 15:22:52 2006 | <Ganneff> Overfiend: yes
Tue Jul 11 15:22:55 2006 | * Maulkin waves
Tue Jul 11 15:22:57 2006 | <Overfiend> probably 1900 or 2000 uTC
Tue Jul 11 15:23:01 2006 | <Maulkin> (fine by me)
Tue Jul 11 15:23:20 2006 | <Maulkin> I think. I'll need to verify.
Tue Jul 11 15:23:23 2006 | <bdale> Aug 1 is likely to also be a challenge for me, but again, I'll do my best to make it work
Tue Jul 11 15:23:30 2006 | <Overfiend> Maulkin: gack.  I was dereferencing your nick to a different person.  I'm getting senile.
Tue Jul 11 15:23:37 2006 | <Maulkin> :)
Tue Jul 11 15:23:47 2006 | <Hydroxide> bdale: well, it's most important only if you plan to run for an officer position, though we'll need more than that to make quorum
Tue Jul 11 15:24:01 2006 | <Hydroxide> because as I proposed it this is a special limited-purpose meeting
Tue Jul 11 15:24:08 2006 | <CosmicRay> ok, are we done discussing the next meeting time?
Tue Jul 11 15:24:10 2006 | <Hydroxide> anyway, shall we move on to the minutes?
Tue Jul 11 15:24:20 2006 | <Overfiend> no objecttion to moving on
Tue Jul 11 15:24:26 2006 | <bdale> still mtg on 15th, right?
Tue Jul 11 15:24:31 2006 | <CosmicRay> one more thing -- I'd just like to thank everyone at SPI for their patience and support with me these last 2 years.
Tue Jul 11 15:24:45 2006 | <Hydroxide> bdale: Aug 15? that's my understanding too
Tue Jul 11 15:24:52 2006 | * bdale marks his calendar
Tue Jul 11 15:24:56 2006 | <mako> CosmicRay: thank you for all your hard work :)
Tue Jul 11 15:24:57 2006 | <CosmicRay> OK.  Aug. 15..  minutes... cdlu?
Tue Jul 11 15:25:01 2006 | <Hydroxide> CosmicRay: yes, thank you for what you've done
Tue Jul 11 15:25:02 2006 | <cdlu> yes
Tue Jul 11 15:25:02 2006 | <CosmicRay> thanks, mako
Tue Jul 11 15:25:09 2006 | <cdlu> we have two sets of minutes to vote on today
Tue Jul 11 15:25:16 2006 | <Overfiend> I'd like to chastise our outgoing President for not cultivating the drama, weeping, and gnashing of teeth that some former SPI Presidents have.  Whoops.
Tue Jul 11 15:25:17 2006 | <cdlu> I forget the dates, but I think they're March and June
Tue Jul 11 15:25:21 2006 | * cdlu doesn't have the agenda open
Tue Jul 11 15:25:23 2006 | <CosmicRay> yes
Tue Jul 11 15:25:29 2006 | <cdlu> March 21st, and June 20th
Tue Jul 11 15:25:32 2006 | * Hydroxide has read them and is ready to approve them.
Tue Jul 11 15:25:49 2006 | <CosmicRay> Overfiend: I'm sure I could come up with a memorable explitive-laced phrase if given some time ;-)
Tue Jul 11 15:25:55 2006 | <CosmicRay> any discussion before we vote?
Tue Jul 11 15:26:08 2006 | <Overfiend> CosmicRay: :)
Tue Jul 11 15:26:11 2006 | <Overfiend> None from me.
Tue Jul 11 15:26:15 2006 | <mako> no comments from me
Tue Jul 11 15:26:21 2006 | <CosmicRay> hearing none, let's vote to approve the March 21 and June 20 minutes.
Tue Jul 11 15:26:22 2006 | <bdale> no comments

Tue Jul 11 15:26:30 2006 | <Overfiend> damn
Tue Jul 11 15:26:36 2006 | <Overfiend> we need to vote separately, please
Tue Jul 11 15:26:44 2006 | <Overfiend> I must abstain for June 20 when I was not present.
Tue Jul 11 15:26:54 2006 | <Overfiend> I cannot affirm the accuracy of those minutes.
Tue Jul 11 15:26:59 2006 | * bdale was going to ask about that
Tue Jul 11 15:26:59 2006 | <cdlu> Cosmicray, can we have March 21/June 20 as joint separate votes? :)
Tue Jul 11 15:27:00 2006 | <Hydroxide> !vote stop
Tue Jul 11 15:27:04 2006 | <cdlu> !vote abort :)
Tue Jul 11 15:27:14 2006 | <Overfiend> I'm happy to vote in favor for 21 March
Tue Jul 11 15:27:15 2006 | <Hydroxide> !vote bail out

Tue Jul 11 15:27:42 2006 | <slef> BTW, some of the seconds on June 20 seem incomplete to me, but I've not checked that with my notes.
Tue Jul 11 15:27:51 2006 | <cdlu> btw I used half a bottle of asprin writing the march 21st minutes, so I hope you all appreciate them :)
Tue Jul 11 15:27:57 2006 | <CosmicRay> is this everyone?
Tue Jul 11 15:27:59 2006 | <CosmicRay> cdlu: heh

Tue Jul 11 15:29:25 2006 | <CosmicRay> OK.  shall we move on to elections?
Tue Jul 11 15:29:29 2006 | <cdlu> Maulkin, do your magic. :)
Tue Jul 11 15:29:31 2006 | * Hydroxide nods
Tue Jul 11 15:29:34 2006 | <CosmicRay> cdlu, I guess this is your item?
Tue Jul 11 15:29:42 2006 | <Maulkin> cdlu: Will do :)
Tue Jul 11 15:29:43 2006 | <cdlu> I guess so!
Tue Jul 11 15:29:48 2006 | <cdlu> ok, two things about the election
Tue Jul 11 15:30:03 2006 | <cdlu> one, we have more candidates than openings
Tue Jul 11 15:30:07 2006 | <cdlu> so we will definitely be going to a vote
Tue Jul 11 15:30:07 2006 | <Maulkin> (my fault, sorry)
Tue Jul 11 15:30:10 2006 | <cdlu> latest information is:
Tue Jul 11 15:30:10 2006 | <Overfiend> yea!
Tue Jul 11 15:30:11 2006 | <cdlu> http://www.spi-inc.org/secretary/votes/vote5/nominations/
Tue Jul 11 15:30:23 2006 | <cdlu> two, Maulkin has made our voting software work, but is a candidate
Tue Jul 11 15:30:28 2006 | <cdlu> and therefore needs the code audited
Tue Jul 11 15:30:32 2006 | <cdlu> I need a volunteer who is not running
Tue Jul 11 15:30:44 2006 | * cdlu doesn't speak PHP
Tue Jul 11 15:30:53 2006 | <Overfiend> what kind of Canadian election ethics are those?
Tue Jul 11 15:30:58 2006 | <CosmicRay> heh
Tue Jul 11 15:31:04 2006 | <cdlu> it's a Commonwealth thing :)
Tue Jul 11 15:31:05 2006 | <mako> i could take a look at the code
Tue Jul 11 15:31:06 2006 | <Maulkin> I also need someone who can do perl :)
Tue Jul 11 15:31:27 2006 | <cdlu> mako, awesome, can you get together with me and Maulkin after the meeting to discuss details?
Tue Jul 11 15:31:29 2006 | <mako> i've written an election methods library before, so i'm probably as qualified as anyone
Tue Jul 11 15:31:35 2006 | <Joey> cdlu: maybe you could add to that page some info who will leave the board as well?
Tue Jul 11 15:31:44 2006 | <Overfiend> mako: really?  I didn't know that.  Which one?
Tue Jul 11 15:32:11 2006 | <mako> Overfiend: rubyvote.rubyforge.org
Tue Jul 11 15:32:14 2006 | <Overfiend> ahhhh, I vaguely remember that
Tue Jul 11 15:32:27 2006 | <Overfiend> mako: if I give my EM talk again, I'll add a ref to it
Tue Jul 11 15:32:50 2006 | <cdlu> Joey, done.
Tue Jul 11 15:32:59 2006 | <cdlu> I also added today's attendance to the table
Tue Jul 11 15:33:01 2006 | <mako> Overfiend: i started writing a simple rails frontend to it today.. maybe for next years election :)
Tue Jul 11 15:33:10 2006 | <Hydroxide> mako: cool
Tue Jul 11 15:33:12 2006 | <Overfiend> awesome, you covert all 4 methods my talk addresses
Tue Jul 11 15:33:14 2006 | <Joey> cdlu: Wow, that was fast!
Tue Jul 11 15:33:19 2006 | <Overfiend> s/covert/cover/
Tue Jul 11 15:33:21 2006 | <CosmicRay> cdlu: did you have anything else to add on the call for nominations?
Tue Jul 11 15:33:26 2006 | <cdlu> nope
Tue Jul 11 15:33:28 2006 | <cdlu> I'm done
Tue Jul 11 15:33:48 2006 | <CosmicRay> OK, then we have the Spanish trademark situation.
Tue Jul 11 15:33:55 2006 | <Hydroxide> CosmicRay: I have an update on that in the agenda
Tue Jul 11 15:34:16 2006 | <Hydroxide> CosmicRay: the "last Wednesday" referred to in that item is June 21
Tue Jul 11 15:34:19 2006 | <Overfiend> a resolution, no less
Tue Jul 11 15:34:30 2006 | <Hydroxide> Overfiend: see? not a total slacker! ;)
Tue Jul 11 15:34:38 2006 | <CosmicRay> so you haven't heard back from Greg yet?
Tue Jul 11 15:34:43 2006 | <Hydroxide> CosmicRay: no
Tue Jul 11 15:34:46 2006 | <Overfiend> Hmmm.
Tue Jul 11 15:34:53 2006 | <CosmicRay> I guess we really ought to wait until we hear back.
Tue Jul 11 15:35:09 2006 | <bdale> poke him again?
Tue Jul 11 15:35:12 2006 | <Overfiend> Let's modify the resolution to just take effect pending approval of counsel.
Tue Jul 11 15:35:16 2006 | <Hydroxide> bdale: yeah, via email this time I guess
Tue Jul 11 15:35:21 2006 | <Overfiend> I think we should move forward
Tue Jul 11 15:35:43 2006 | * Overfiend proposes an amendment:
Tue Jul 11 15:35:45 2006 | <bdale> I don't see the point if it's contingent on Greg
Tue Jul 11 15:35:59 2006 | <Overfiend> after "THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT"
Tue Jul 11 15:36:09 2006 | <bdale> we've got mtgs on 1 and 15 Aug at which this could be added to the agenda if Greg has replied
Tue Jul 11 15:36:16 2006 | <Overfiend> add "Pending approval from our counsel:"
Tue Jul 11 15:36:34 2006 | <CosmicRay> Overfiend: this could get sticky if he doesn't give a straight up or down, but rather a list of risks and benefits
Tue Jul 11 15:36:39 2006 | <cdlu> at this point we'd best leave it for the new board following the election, without having heard from greg.
Tue Jul 11 15:36:41 2006 | <Overfiend> CosmicRay: true
Tue Jul 11 15:36:53 2006 | <bdale> right, I think we need Greg's advice before I'm prepared to vote
Tue Jul 11 15:36:55 2006 | <cdlu> seeing as results are only a bit over 2 weeks away
Tue Jul 11 15:37:07 2006 | <CosmicRay> Overfiend: but I certainly see the need to move quickly.
Tue Jul 11 15:37:08 2006 | * Overfiend withdraws his amendment.
Tue Jul 11 15:37:12 2006 | <CosmicRay> I guess we could always vote by email.
Tue Jul 11 15:37:19 2006 | <bdale> that's exactly what I asserted the last time(s) this came up on the agenda, fwiw
Tue Jul 11 15:37:27 2006 | <Overfiend> No, I agree.  It's never wise to count on a simple answer from a lawyer :)
Tue Jul 11 15:37:37 2006 | <cdlu> this has been postponed for several months, but it's also a rather tough matter
Tue Jul 11 15:37:59 2006 | <Overfiend> would someone like to remind Greg via a phone call maybe?
Tue Jul 11 15:38:14 2006 | <bdale> the dependencies haven't changed in a couple of months, at least.  someone please get advice for us from Greg so we can decide how to proceed, please.
Tue Jul 11 15:38:49 2006 | <Hydroxide> Overfiend: I can ping him again within the next few days, although I think email is probably a reasonable next means of communication to try.
Tue Jul 11 15:38:56 2006 | <Overfiend> Hydroxide: okay.
Tue Jul 11 15:39:33 2006 | * mako nods
Tue Jul 11 15:39:42 2006 | <Overfiend> CosmicRay: next item?
Tue Jul 11 15:40:11 2006 | <CosmicRay> Right.... anything more to cover on tax filing and bookkeeping?
Tue Jul 11 15:40:13 2006 | * Hydroxide also has an update on this item in the agenda (needing Branden to supplement it with the status of work with MBS to get the IRS 990-EZ data ready).
Tue Jul 11 15:40:34 2006 | <cdlu> CosmicRay, I did have one quick thing to add that I forgot about from before: if anyone has any challenges to their posted attendance record, please let me know. It's accurate to the best of my knowledge.
Tue Jul 11 15:41:11 2006 | <Overfiend> A challenge?  Can we resolve such disputes with flintlocks at twenty paces?
Tue Jul 11 15:41:17 2006 | <cdlu> I'd love to see that
Tue Jul 11 15:41:30 2006 | <cdlu> but one party would probably miss it, without regrets.
Tue Jul 11 15:41:33 2006 | * Hydroxide gently redirects the rowdy boys back to being on-topic
Tue Jul 11 15:41:48 2006 | <Overfiend> sorry.  Had insomnia last night and am punchy.
Tue Jul 11 15:41:59 2006 | <CosmicRay> hehe
Tue Jul 11 15:42:04 2006 | <CosmicRay> anyway, bookkeeping/tax filing?
Tue Jul 11 15:42:07 2006 | <Overfiend> basically, tax filing and bookeeping are in my corner.
Tue Jul 11 15:42:20 2006 | <Overfiend> I had them slated for week before last, then PostgreSQL blew up in my face
Tue Jul 11 15:42:27 2006 | <Overfiend> and last week was shot due to the holidays
Tue Jul 11 15:42:33 2006 | <Overfiend> trying again this week
Tue Jul 11 15:42:38 2006 | <Hydroxide> CosmicRay: see agenda for my update on that, in addition to listening to what Branden's saying
Tue Jul 11 15:42:59 2006 | <Overfiend> avoidance of further gigantic money transfers requiring my involvement would help :)
Tue Jul 11 15:43:04 2006 | <CosmicRay> heh
Tue Jul 11 15:43:14 2006 | <Hydroxide> Overfiend: hey, I did the most recent, much more gigantic, wire transfer
Tue Jul 11 15:43:22 2006 | <Overfiend> and I appreciate it :)
Tue Jul 11 15:43:29 2006 | <cdlu> ok guys you can stop measuring your wire transfers now :)
Tue Jul 11 15:43:34 2006 | <Hydroxide> hahaha
Tue Jul 11 15:43:52 2006 | <Hydroxide> continuons
Tue Jul 11 15:44:03 2006 | <cdlu> mr. president, bring us back in line? we seem to have lost a few members' attention
Tue Jul 11 15:44:14 2006 | <Overfiend> Hydroxide: what do the fundamental particles that make up the space-time continuum have to do with our Board meeting?
Tue Jul 11 15:44:16 2006 | <CosmicRay> ok, anything else?
Tue Jul 11 15:44:25 2006 | <Hydroxide> Overfiend: it was french for "let's continue"
Tue Jul 11 15:44:26 2006 | <CosmicRay> whall we move on to the website rebuild?
Tue Jul 11 15:44:29 2006 | <Overfiend> expect an update from me this week
Tue Jul 11 15:44:44 2006 | <CosmicRay> website rebuild it is then...
Tue Jul 11 15:44:45 2006 | <Overfiend> if you don't get one, feel free to call my cell phone and lay a guilt trip on me
Tue Jul 11 15:44:47 2006 | <CosmicRay> how's that coming?
Tue Jul 11 15:44:52 2006 | <cdlu> Maulkin, any word on website rebuild?
Tue Jul 11 15:44:57 2006 | <bdale> Overfiend: that works?
Tue Jul 11 15:45:01 2006 | <Maulkin> Yup
Tue Jul 11 15:45:09 2006 | <cdlu> pray tell :)
Tue Jul 11 15:45:13 2006 | <Overfiend> bdale: actually, yes.  People practically never call me for any reason
Tue Jul 11 15:45:17 2006 | <Maulkin> Thanks to BlackCat Networks, we've been given another server
Tue Jul 11 15:45:25 2006 | <Overfiend> bdale: even urgent stuff they know I care about
Tue Jul 11 15:45:28 2006 | <Maulkin> more powerful, and with more ram
Tue Jul 11 15:45:38 2006 | <CosmicRay> whee
Tue Jul 11 15:45:49 2006 | <Maulkin> This happened today, and the server transition should start to happen now-ish
Tue Jul 11 15:45:57 2006 | <cdlu> cool :)
Tue Jul 11 15:45:57 2006 | <Maulkin> It's expected to take 1->2 weeks
Tue Jul 11 15:46:08 2006 | <Maulkin> In terms of the actual website, I consider it ready for deployment
Tue Jul 11 15:46:10 2006 | <Overfiend> Maulkin: are you now, or are you becoming, a member of spi-admin?
Tue Jul 11 15:46:22 2006 | <Overfiend> sorry to get McCarthyesque on you
Tue Jul 11 15:46:28 2006 | <Maulkin> Overfiend: No, I'm not, and havent been asked to.
Tue Jul 11 15:46:36 2006 | <Overfiend> hmmm, okay.
Tue Jul 11 15:46:47 2006 | <Maulkin> I'm admin on teh website though, and have an account on chic
Tue Jul 11 15:46:49 2006 | <Overfiend> I had an spi-adminny question.  It can wait.
Tue Jul 11 15:47:05 2006 | <Maulkin> (and root on the new box, but that'll dissapear soon I suspect)
Tue Jul 11 15:47:15 2006 | <Overfiend> Maulkin: BTW, if you're interested, it'd be better to volunteer than wait for an invite
Tue Jul 11 15:47:32 2006 | <CosmicRay> OK, anything else?
Tue Jul 11 15:47:36 2006 | <Overfiend> Maulkin: the only way anything gets done in SPI is due to people bulling their way in and fucking it up.
Tue Jul 11 15:47:37 2006 | <Maulkin> Overfiend: I may well do, but personally, I'd like to see Ganneff take that role first :)
Tue Jul 11 15:47:47 2006 | <Ganneff> sure :)
Tue Jul 11 15:47:51 2006 | <CosmicRay> any further business before we close this annual meeting?
Tue Jul 11 15:47:58 2006 | <bdale> CosmicRay: sounds like we're done
Tue Jul 11 15:48:01 2006 | <Overfiend> Maulkin: yeah, soon Ganneff will have root on every machine that has anything to do with the Debian Project :)
Tue Jul 11 15:48:02 2006 | <cdlu> CosmicRay, only one thing
Tue Jul 11 15:48:06 2006 | <CosmicRay> cdlu: go ahead
Tue Jul 11 15:48:26 2006 | <Ganneff> Overfiend: is that bad?
Tue Jul 11 15:48:28 2006 | <cdlu> CosmicRay, I'd like to thank you and mako for your years of service on the board, and particularly your two years as president/vice president, seeing as neither of you appear to be seeking re-election.
Tue Jul 11 15:48:28 2006 | <slef> Overfiend: that's not a good thing.
Tue Jul 11 15:48:28 2006 | <Maulkin> Lol
Tue Jul 11 15:48:41 2006 | <CosmicRay> thank you, cdlu.
Tue Jul 11 15:48:42 2006 | <Overfiend> hear, hear
Tue Jul 11 15:48:46 2006 | <bdale> ditto
Tue Jul 11 15:48:59 2006 | <Joey> well, yeah, sure, that should be implicitly.
Tue Jul 11 15:49:02 2006 | <Joey> -ly
Tue Jul 11 15:49:05 2006 | <CosmicRay> thanks also for keeping me on my toes behind the scenes in oh so many ways
Tue Jul 11 15:49:16 2006 | <Overfiend> Ganneff: well, yes, if it can be avoided
Tue Jul 11 15:49:20 2006 | <cdlu> damnit, keep that curtain down :)
Tue Jul 11 15:49:23 2006 | <CosmicRay> anything else?
Tue Jul 11 15:49:24 2006 | <CosmicRay> heh
Tue Jul 11 15:49:39 2006 | <cdlu> I guess that's it. Are we agreed to the August 1st meeting?
Tue Jul 11 15:49:40 2006 | <CosmicRay> in that case, this meeting of SPI is adjourned until August 15
Tue Jul 11 15:49:42 2006 | <CosmicRay> err.
Tue Jul 11 15:49:44 2006 | <Ganneff> Overfiend: why?
Tue Jul 11 15:49:45 2006 | <CosmicRay> august 1?
Tue Jul 11 15:49:48 2006 | <Overfiend> thanks, folks
Tue Jul 11 15:49:48 2006 | <CosmicRay> which is it? ;-)
Tue Jul 11 15:49:56 2006 | <Hydroxide> Overfiend: is Ganneff on DSA? He's not listed on the Debian organizational page. Now, Joey is, but not Ganneff.
Tue Jul 11 15:50:05 2006 | <Ganneff> Hydroxide: no, (not yet?)
Tue Jul 11 15:50:06 2006 | <cdlu> that's what i'm asking :)
Tue Jul 11 15:50:08 2006 | <Overfiend> Ganneff: because it's good to have diversification of authority figures
Tue Jul 11 15:50:14 2006 | <mako> thanks cdlu
Tue Jul 11 15:50:15 2006 | <Overfiend> Ganneff: when possible.  Often it's not
Tue Jul 11 15:50:31 2006 | <Overfiend> Ganneff: as in volunteer organizations -- one can easily end up with the tyranny of the janitors
Tue Jul 11 15:50:36 2006 | <Joey> Hydroxide: He's on the debian-admin@lists.debian.org list, but is not a Debian admin but a local admin of two machines.
Tue Jul 11 15:50:43 2006 | <Ganneff> Overfiend: admin is no authorization usually.
Tue Jul 11 15:50:47 2006 | <Hydroxide> Joey: right
Tue Jul 11 15:50:59 2006 | <Joey> ^of^on
Tue Jul 11 15:51:06 2006 | <Ganneff> Overfiend: usually you do what the users need. :)
Tue Jul 11 15:51:10 2006 | <Hydroxide> Joey: Ganneff, you mean?
Tue Jul 11 15:51:15 2006 | <Joey> Hydroxide: sure
Tue Jul 11 15:51:16 2006 | <Overfiend> Ganneff: my objecttion is philosophical, not personal, and furthermore, I acknowledge its practical limitations... :)
Tue Jul 11 15:51:28 2006 | <cdlu> do we have a decision on August 1st/15th, or did it get dropped? :)
Tue Jul 11 15:51:38 2006 | <CosmicRay> can we figure out when the next meeting is, so we can end this one? ;-)
Tue Jul 11 15:51:39 2006 | <Overfiend> We agreed on 1 August earlier
Tue Jul 11 15:51:46 2006 | <Hydroxide> cdlu: I thought it was August 1 for the very limited purpose of choosing new officers and nothing else
Tue Jul 11 15:51:47 2006 | <Overfiend> I believe.
Tue Jul 11 15:51:49 2006 | <Joey> cdlu: I fear it got dropped somehow, but I'd also like to fix it in my calendar
Tue Jul 11 15:51:49 2006 | <Overfiend> right
Tue Jul 11 15:51:53 2006 | <Hydroxide> cdlu: and then August 15 for everything else
Tue Jul 11 15:51:53 2006 | <CosmicRay> ok, good enough.
Tue Jul 11 15:51:56 2006 | <cdlu> ok, souds good to me.
Tue Jul 11 15:52:01 2006 | <Overfiend> 1 August 1900UTC for officer elections.
Tue Jul 11 15:52:03 2006 | <cdlu> cool. savour this last gavel banging :)
Tue Jul 11 15:52:06 2006 | <CosmicRay> this meeting of SPI is adjourned until August 1 at 1900 UTC
Tue Jul 11 15:52:08 2006 | <Overfiend> 15 August 1900UTC for regular business.
Tue Jul 11 15:52:11 2006 | <CosmicRay> *GAVEL GAVEL GAVEL*

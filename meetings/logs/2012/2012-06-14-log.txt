21:16 #spi: < bdale> [item 7, Items up for discussion]
21:16 #spi: < bdale> [item 7.1, Resolution 2012-05-17.mcs.1 (Removal of OpenOffice.org as associated project)]
21:16 #spi: < bdale> This is carried over from last month since we failed to meet quorum.
21:16 #spi: < bdale> Technically, a vote isn't necessary, but it has been our custom to mark such occasions with a formal resolution in the past.
21:16 #spi: < bdale> Does this require any discussion, or can we move directly to a vote?
21:16 #spi: < Ganneff> move
21:16 #spi: < Solver> I think it is pretty straight forward
21:16 #spi: < Noodles> Seems fine to me. They want it.
21:16 #spi: < schultmc> I think we can go to a vote
21:16 #spi: < schultmc> I do need to follow up with them on the financial transfer
21:16 #spi: < schultmc> but that shouldn't affect the vote
21:16 #spi: < Noodles> Voting started, 6 people (clint,schultmc,solver,bdale,ganneff,noodles) allowed to vote on Resolution 2012-05-17.mcs.1 (Removal of OpenOffice.org as associated project). - You may vote yes/no/abstain only, type !vote $yourchoice now.

21:16 #spi: < Ganneff> !vote yes
21:16 #spi: < bdale> !vote yes
21:16 #spi: < Noodles> !vote yes
21:16 #spi: < Noodles> Current voting results for "Resolution 2012-05-17.mcs.1 (Removal of OpenOffice.org as associated project)": Yes: 6, No: 0, Abstain: 0, Missing: 0 ()
21:16 #spi: < Noodles> Voting for "Resolution 2012-05-17.mcs.1 (Removal of OpenOffice.org as associated project)" closed.
21:17 #spi: < bdale> schultmc: yes, please handle the logistics as needed with them
21:17 #spi: < bdale> [item 7.2, Resolution 2012-05-25.rtb.1 (FFmpeg as SPI associated project)
21:17 #spi: < bdale> Robert?
21:17 #spi: < Solver> ok...
21:17 #spi: < Solver> so as you know there was a concern raised by Ian Jackson about the wording of the proposal
21:18 #spi: < Solver> my position is that the concern relates to the wording of the template, not this proposal
21:18 #spi: < bdale> I agree
21:18 #spi: < Solver> i believe the concern over the wording should not effect the vote on this proposal at all
21:18 #spi: < bdale> it would be ok to suggest an amendment to fix the wording, though, if you wish
21:18 #spi: < schultmc> he sent mail to -general today that suggested a re-wording of some of this resolution
21:19 #spi: < Solver> if the wording is an issue we will need to go and fix all of the old resolutions anyway
21:19 #spi: < Clint> have there been situations before where we've declared someone an authoritative decisionmaker when they weren't?
21:19 #spi: < bdale> in the past, we've even word-smithed in these meetings, though I discourage it because it's slow
21:19 #spi: < Solver> I am cautious about making up wording on the spot or under time pressure
21:19 #spi: < Noodles> We've liked to have some defined way we can tell who's the decision maker for the project.
21:19 #spi: < bdale> Solver: I disagree with the notion that fixing means we have to go backwards in time, it's ok to fix forward and live with what's there until/unless it causes a problem
21:19 #spi: < Noodles> Like a mention on the official website or some easy way we as an organisation can verify what the project wants.
21:20 #spi: < Solver> there was little discussion on the mailing list aspect of the resolution
21:20 #spi: < Clint> also "consensus" is misspelled
21:20 #spi: < bdale> so we have three choices.  vote on it as currently worded.  fix the wording here and vote the amended resolution.  table until next month when hopefully we'd have fixed text.  opinions?
21:21 #spi: < Solver> Clint: ok can we fix the spelling in the offical version
21:21 #spi: < Clint> i oppose rushing
21:21 #spi: < Solver> I don't want ffmpeg to be disadvantaged on what is in effect a wider problem
21:21 #spi: < jcristau> Clint: it should be spelled "liason"?
21:21 #spi: < bdale> is the ffmpeg project under time pressure to accept a donation or anything like that?
21:21 #spi: < Clint> jcristau: ttb
21:21 #spi: < Solver> saste: is there a time pressure on the ffmpeg project?
21:22 #spi: < saste> bdale: not that i know, but of course the soon the better for us
21:22 #spi: < saste> considering that we'll need some time to correctly setup all the stuff (website and all)
21:22 #spi: < bdale> saste: put differently, is it ok if we defer until next month's meeting actually voting the resolution?
21:22 #spi: < saste> i'm not against
21:22 #spi: < bdale> I see no objections to the association at all, this is just a question of getting the text right
21:23 #spi: < bdale> Solver: ok, this is your resolution, what would you like to do with it?
21:23 #spi: < Solver> is there a concern about the use of the mailing list in the resolution?  I had expected that to get discussed on list but it wasn't
21:23 #spi: < Solver> Ian Jackson's concern is about a different part of the resolution
21:23 #spi: < Clint> i am not concerned about the mailing list either
21:24 #spi: < saste> yes, also please state it clearly what we (ffmpeg) need to do in order to fix the application text, and if we need to fix the governance structure anyhow
21:24 #spi: < bdale> ok, a few comments
21:25 #spi: < bdale> in an ideal world, projects would have a well-defined process for determining who speaks authoritatively for the project, and our resolutions would just reference that
21:25 #spi: < Solver> bdale: I had hoped to proceed with it today
21:25 #spi: < bdale> when there is no such well defined process already in place, we end up codifying more in the resolution than we necessarily want to
21:25 #spi: < Solver> but only if the board is ready to proceed
21:25 #spi: < Clint> saste: consider what would have happened if ffmpeg were an spi associated project when the libav thing occurred
21:25 #spi: < Solver> the mailing list component did make me wonder
21:26 #spi: < Solver> I reviewed other resolutions
21:26 #spi: < Solver> and concluded it wasn't so different to Arch Linux which, IIRC, references a group of developers
21:26 #spi: < bdale> yes, we've approved various forms in the past
21:27 #spi: < Solver> if the only problem is the use of the wording "authoritative decision maker" then I would hope that we pass the resolution and find a systemic fix later (assuming the wording is a problem, which isn't established)
21:27 #spi: < bdale> I personally would vote to approve the resolution as written, but am comfortable waiting until next month if that would yield better text everyone can feel good about *and* we're not overly inconveniencing the project, by which I mean making it impossible for them to accept a known inbound donation or something like that
21:28 #spi: < bdale> how do others feel?  should we just call a vote?
21:28 #spi: < schultmc> we have accepted donations prior to a pending association
21:28 #spi: < bdale> yes, we have, though we try not to when we don't need to
21:28 #spi: < schultmc> right
21:29 #spi: < bdale> is there any discussion about substantive issues related to associating ffmpeg?
21:29 #spi: < Noodles> I don't think I have any concerns about them as an associated project.
21:30 #spi: < Noodles> I'd prefer something firmer for the process of knowing who we talk to, but not enough to vote against it as it stands.
21:30 #spi: < bdale> if not, then I think we should call a vote and let folks either accept the wording as it's there or vote against it, knowing it'll be back next month in that case.  make sense?
21:30 #spi: < Solver> bdale: agreed
21:30 #spi:  * Clint nods.
21:30 #spi: < Noodles> So vote?
21:30 #spi: < bdale> lets
21:30 #spi: < Noodles> Voting started, 6 people (clint,schultmc,solver,bdale,ganneff,noodles) allowed to vote on Resolution 2012-05-25.rtb.1 (FFmpeg as SPI associated project). - You may vote yes/no/abstain only, type !vote $yourchoice now.

21:31 #spi: < Noodles> Voting for "Resolution 2012-05-25.rtb.1 (FFmpeg as SPI associated project)" closed.
21:31 #spi: < bdale> ok
21:31 #spi: < Solver> thanks everyone
21:31 #spi: < Solver> I'll follow up on other business about that wording...
21:32 #spi: < bdale> thanks .. if you'd take the lead on a template update, I'm happy to help
21:32 #spi: < Solver> thanks.  as per what I said on list, I will refer it to SFLC (I have not done so yet but will within a couple of days).  that's all I was going to put in other business on that topic, anyway
21:33 #spi: < bdale> Noodles: since saste is on channel, want to do the official invite now?
21:33 #spi: < Noodles> saste: As you can see we have voted to accept ffmpeg as an SPI associated project. Do you wish to accept on behalf of the project?
21:33 #spi: < saste> Noodles: yes i do
21:33 #spi: < bdale> cool.  saste, welcome to SPI!
21:33 #spi: < Noodles> You'll need to send me (secretary@spi-inc.org) a logo and some blurb for you /projects/ page.
21:34 #spi: < saste> thank you
21:34 #spi: < bdale> [item 8, Any other business]
21:34 #spi: < bdale> Do any board members have other items for discussion they would like to address briefly?
21:34 #spi: < Solver> yes one thanks
21:34 #spi: < bdale> Noodles: let's talk election
21:34 #spi: < Noodles> As mentioned earlier, that's coming up.
21:34 #spi: < saste> and i told, we're open to suggestions related to the decision process and all
21:34 #spi: < Noodles> Michael and I are up for re-election.
21:34 #spi: < saste> and we're aware that it has some open problems which should be addressed
21:34 #spi: < Ganneff> Whats with linuxpoet?
21:34 #spi: < Noodles> I've asked zobel to run the voting; I'm not sure if I'm going to stand for re-election or not but that makes things easier.
21:35 #spi: < Ganneff> should we ask him if he wants to step down - or intends to come back active?
21:35 #spi: < Ganneff> (like, attending any meeting?)
21:35 #spi: < Solver> Ganneff: yes that seems reasonable
21:35 #spi: < bdale> Ganneff: yes, I think we should ping him about continued interest, since his recent string of meeting attendance fails is affecting out ability to meet quorum
21:35 #spi: < Ganneff> who?
21:35 #spi: < bdale> our, even
21:35 #spi: < Clint> is Bruce the only similar case?
21:35 #spi: < bdale> perhaps I should do that myself?
21:36 #spi: < Noodles> bdale: Either you or I should do it I think.
21:36 #spi: < bdale> Noodles: which would you prefer?
21:36 #spi: < Noodles> I'm happy to drop him a mail and ask what his status is.
21:36 #spi: < bdale> thanks .. feel free to CC me and/or rest of board
21:37 #spi: < bdale> so we need to wine and dine you and Michael to make sure you intend to continue, so noted
21:37 #spi: < Solver> indeed :)
21:37 #spi: < bdale> the other big issue is scrubbing the contrib member list?
21:37 #spi: < Noodles> In terms of the election nominations open on 1st July, so anyone who's observing and thinking about running should bear that in mind.
21:37 #spi: < bdale> right
21:37 #spi: < Noodles> There's been no progress on that unfortunately (list scrubbing).
21:37 #spi: < bdale> sounds like we'll have 2 or possibly 3 positions to fill, and I'd love to have an actual meaningful vote
21:38 #spi: < Solver> so did we contact everyone who didn't vote?
21:38 #spi: < Solver> which i understand is the first step in the scrubbing process
21:38 #spi: < Noodles> Solver: No.
21:38 #spi: < Noodles> Because of the sheer numbers involved making manual processing of the responses a bigger task than expected.
21:38 #spi: < Solver> is it now too late to do that before the election?
21:39 #spi: < bdale> I don't think so
21:39 #spi: < Noodles> I don't think the election really impacts it much.
21:39 #spi: < bdale> we haven't opened nominations yet, and the process has until we start to vote to be completed
21:39 #spi: < Solver> ah ok
21:39 #spi: < Solver> just rereading that resolution..
21:39 #spi: < bdale> well, it goes to the question of what constitutes quorum for the election, but we don't tend to have trouble making quorum
21:40 #spi: < bdale> there's concern we could get to that point if we don't scrub, but...
21:40 #spi: < Noodles> We're nowhere near that point for a board election.
21:40 #spi: < bdale> ok, so let's take the scrubbing discussion to email and not sweat it here
21:41 #spi: < yp17> How many new contrib memeber were added last year ?
21:41 #spi: < bdale> so we're opening nominations on 1 July, zobel will administer the logistics to avoid any issues with Noodles as a candidate.  any other election issues?
21:41 #spi: < Hydroxide> gah. moving day at the office and spi meeting day clashed worse than planned. soery guys. did yoy make quoeum?
21:41 #spi: < bdale> yes
21:41 #spi: < bdale> now in AOB
21:41 #spi: < Hydroxide> (am on phone, yay typoes)
21:41 #spi: < Hydroxide> cool
21:41 #spi: < bdale> nothing heard, so I assume our election discussion is complete
21:41 #spi: < Solver> bdale: I have one item when you are ready
21:42 #spi: < bdale> Solver: go
21:42 #spi: < Solver> I just wanted to check on the status of the financial information that we need to provide to debian.  this was going to be aised last time but we were inquorate
21:42 #spi: < Solver> *raised
21:43 #spi: < bdale> schultmc ?
21:43 #spi: < Solver> I have a suggestion about how to resolve that if it is still outstanding
21:43 #spi: < bdale> I've heard nothing more
21:44 #spi: < schultmc> i'm in the process of gathering the info
21:44 #spi: < bdale> schultmc: any sense of when this will be completed?
21:44 #spi: < schultmc> their auditor requested a subset of the data that I can provide more immediately
21:44 #spi: < Solver> schultmc: thanks.  I appreciate the work load a treasurer gets put on them
21:44 #spi: < schultmc> the full data can most likely be provided by the end of june
21:45 #spi: < bdale> ok .. if you need help, please say so
21:45 #spi: < schultmc> will do
21:45 #spi: < bdale> [item 9, Next board meeting]
21:45 #spi: < bdale> Our next regularly-scheduled monthly meeting would be 12th July 2012, 20:00 UTC, which falls during Debconf week.
21:45 #spi: < bdale> Any strong objections?
21:46 #spi: < Solver> that's fine by me.
21:46 #spi: < Noodles> Fine with me.
21:46 #spi: < Clint> i can't make it
21:46 #spi: < schultmc> ditto
21:46 #spi: < schultmc> (fine with me)
21:46 #spi: < Ganneff> i dont care
21:46 #spi: < Solver> I rarely have conflicting appointments at 6am :)
21:46 #spi: < bdale> ok, date and time stand
21:46 #spi: < bdale> Ok, thank you to everyone present for participating today.
21:46 #spi: < bdale> *GAVEL*

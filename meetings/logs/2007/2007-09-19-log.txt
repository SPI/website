21:05 < Ganneff> [item 7, Stuff for discussion]
21:05 < Ganneff> 2007-09-19.jdd.1 - Review and determination of transaction providers
21:05 < Ganneff> i guess thats linuxpoet s floor now
21:05 < linuxpoet> Are there any questions? I thought it was hashed out fairly well on -private
21:06 < jberkus> can I have a link to the final version?
21:06 < luk> I don't really like the at least every 12 months with volunteers
21:06 < linuxpoet> http://www.spi-inc.org/secretary/agenda/2007/2007-09-19.html
21:06 < jberkus> luk: we can pay an intern
21:06 < schultmc> that's the agenda - the resolution isn't linked
21:06 < cdlu> schultmc, as the person most directly affected by the resolution, what do you think?
21:06 < Maulkin> Personally, I'm not happy approving it when there hasn't been the work done anyway.
21:06 < linuxpoet> schultmc: yes it is
21:06 < jberkus> looks good to me
21:06 < jberkus> schultmc: yes, it is
21:07 < Ganneff> schultmc: it is
21:07 < schultmc> ah, is now
21:07  * schultmc just refreshed
21:07 < jberkus> schultmc: I can have Frannie do a lot of the legwork
21:07 < luk> I would rather go for 'at least every 12 months if at all possible'
21:07 < Maulkin> Is there a degree of urgency to have this resolution passed before the review is completed?
21:07 < linuxpoet> Maulkin: I have already stated that I am willing to help
21:07 < schultmc> as long as jberkus or I aren't required to do the work ourselves I'm fine with it
21:07 < schultmc> I agree that a periodic review should be done
21:07 < Maulkin> linuxpoet: That wasn't my point.
21:08 < zobel> i ack with luk here
21:08 < linuxpoet> Maulkin: well my point is, in my opinion it shouldl have been in place since the inception of this corporation
21:08 < linuxpoet> The fact that it isn't is bad news imo
21:08 < linuxpoet> or something like it anyway
21:09 < linuxpoet> Anyway, I am more than willing to put my fair share of time in, and if we have an intern to help that is even better because I can work with that individual
21:10 < luk> I think it's good to have these reviews, but it's bad to make them absolutely obligatory
21:10 < luk> IMHO
21:10 < Maulkin> linuxpoet: 21:07 < luk> I would rather go for 'at least every 12 months if at all possible'
21:10 < Maulkin> Want to incorporate that, or not?
21:10 < Ganneff> soo, do we want to vote on this now or do we select "more discussion on lists"?
21:10 < linuxpoet> Maulkin: I am confused
21:11 < Maulkin> ok: basics :)
21:11 < linuxpoet> Maulkin: my says at least every 12 months
21:11 < Maulkin> You can incorporate that into your resolution or not.
21:11 < cdlu> linuxpoet, it's the "if at all possible" bit that's important here
21:11 < Maulkin> If you do, we just vote on the resolution
21:11 < Maulkin> If not, someone can propose that as an amendment.
21:11 < linuxpoet> I do not find that required, as the board can always call a vote to defer
21:11 < luk> bad
21:12 < Maulkin> If it passes, we vote on the amended version. If not, the original.
21:12 < cdlu> luk, want to move the amendment?
21:12 < Maulkin> Basically: do you want to amend your resolution to include that?
21:12  * linuxpoet thinking
21:13 < cdlu> linuxpoet, if you consider it a friendly amendment then we can put it right to a vote and dispose of it. does it hurt your resolution's purpose?
21:13 < RichiH> if everyone agrees that periodic is good and some/one think it is bad to go for mandatory every year, couldn't 12 month be the target and 24 months a hard requirement?
21:13 < linuxpoet> cdlu: My concern is simple, the amendment opens the door for, "I couldn't get to it..."
21:14 < linuxpoet> which seems to happen quite a bit
21:14 < jberkus> if it's a resolution, it justifies the treasurer paying for it
21:14 < cdlu> linuxpoet, there's no mechanism to enforce the occurence of the review anyway, so not having that there won't create a condition where it'll automatically happen.
21:14 < Maulkin> Ok. Should we just do them seperately?
21:14 < luk> and if it is not done, there should be very good reasons otherwise it would have been possible...
21:14 < cdlu> jberkus, if funding is included in the resolution it does.
21:14 < linuxpoet> cdlu:  The first review of financial providers shall be completed and documented by December 31st, 2007 and then at least within every 12 months thereafter.
21:15 < cdlu> or the funding falls within the treasurer's $100/month budget
21:15 < jberkus> cdlu: um, the treasurer has only $100 per month?
21:15 < cdlu> unless something changed?
21:16 < cdlu> "reasonable necessity" for tax filing, and $100/month general operating is what I recall.
21:16 < cdlu> Maulkin, yes, if we do them separately we'll actually get to a vote. :)
21:16 < linuxpoet> I believe the resolution is satisfactory. If it doesn't pass. It doesn't pass but I believe I have taken into account all reasonable language and have provided several drafts of modifications. Based on those considerations, plus the fact that I am more than willing to participate in the work itself, I believe we should go to vote.
21:17 < jberkus> um, if what cdlu's saying is correct, then we need a resolution increasing the treasurer's budget
21:17 < Ganneff> jberkus: in a different meeting :)
21:17 < linuxpoet> Ganneff: why
21:17 < linuxpoet> Ganneff: why not just propose a monthly increase to 500.00 and vote
21:17 < jberkus> yeah, but I can't pass linuxpoet's resolution if we can't pay for it
21:18 < jberkus> linuxpoet: I think it should be a % of revenue
21:18 < Ganneff> linuxpoet: cos we dont have a resolution for it
21:18 < cdlu> jberkus, move an amendment authorising reasonable funding for the function of the resolution
21:18 < linuxpoet> jberkus: uhmmm can you pay the intern for the other work as well?
21:18 < jberkus> linuxpoet: maybe
21:18 < jberkus> linuxpoet: your resolution needs funding
21:18 < linuxpoet> jberkus: move an amendment
21:18  * Maulkin moves to vote on luk's amendment
21:19 < jberkus> I move that the resolution include the amendment:
21:19 < jberkus> "The Treasurer is authorized to spend any reasonable funds to complete this review."
21:20 < linuxpoet> I am fine with the jberkus ammendment
21:20 < Ganneff> i second all of those moves (ie - vote on luks, then jberkus amendment), so we can get on with it. :)
21:20 < Maulkin> ok.
21:20 < zobel> mh, what defines reasonable?
21:20 < luk> lol
21:21 < linuxpoet> zobel: it is a common contractural term, meaning exactly that... reasonable

21:28 < schultmc> http://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/meetings has been updated
21:28 < zobel> slef: sorry, i just send the announcement as an "emergency solution" as there was non sent by Maulkin in time.
21:28 < slef> Please can draft minutes or logs be uploaded/linked or mailed?  I thought that used to happen.
21:28 < Ganneff> slef: if the one doing it isnt totally busy in rl, sure.
21:28 < slef> zobel: no probs.  Thanks, as I'd've missed it again otherwise, then posted something very grumpy to -private again.

[16:02:08] <zobel> upps
[16:02:11] <xnox> we were on hangout =)
[16:02:12] <zobel> Martin Zobel-Helas
[16:02:13] <xnox> zobel and I
[16:02:34] <tbm> happy to hear you were working on SPI activities :)
[16:02:38] <tbm> Any questions regarding the report?
[16:02:44] <zobel> give us 5min, then we can publish a combined jan+feb report.
[16:02:52] <xnox> tbm, i just pulled the website and i odn't see the agenda =/
[16:03:03] <xnox> 2016-10-10
[16:03:07] <Hydroxide> http://www.spi-inc.org/meetings/agendas/2016/2016-10-10/
[16:03:08] <tbm> http://spi-inc.org/meetings/agendas/2016/2016-10-10/
[16:03:12] <tbm> I can see it
[16:03:37] <tbm> [item 4, Treasurer's Report]
[16:03:47] <zobel> give us 5min, then we can publish a combined jan+feb report.
[16:04:00] <Ganneff> that cant go into the next?
[16:04:19] <Hydroxide> let's proceed with the next item and come back to this later in the meeting if it's ready in time
[16:04:35] <Hydroxide> 5 minutes is not very long :)
[16:04:54] <tbm> I suggest you give a general overview now and publish the report after the meeting
[16:05:00] <tbm> You don't want to rush the report.
[16:05:03] <Ganneff> plus minutes for people to read, ..... its nice to have reports, but not right inside the meeting
[16:05:05] <tbm> schultmc: any updates from you?
[16:05:27] <schultmc> zobel, xnox and I have been working on the reporting. we're getting scripts together to make the report generating easier
[16:05:34] <tbm> But I'm very happy to see we'll have our first report based on ledger soon
[16:05:39] <Hydroxide> yes, maybe the full report could end up in today's meeting minutes as a retroactive addition, to be approved next month
[16:05:44] <schultmc> many thanks to zobel and xnox for their assistance
[16:05:53] <tbm> Great work, everyone!
[16:06:12] <tbm> Anything else?
[16:06:20] <schultmc> nothing else at the moment
[16:06:30] <xnox> we are done with feb report. fighting with ikiwiki at the moment to publish it =)
[16:06:30] <tbm> [item 5, Secretary's report]
[16:07:12] <spectranaut> So we need to decide on f2f meeting, the most popular dates from the poll are:
[16:07:22] <xnox> (however our january balances do not yet match Michael's report, therefore we are writting comments about that - as there are transactions we account in a different months, that happened at the end of month)
[16:07:38] <spectranaut> weekend of Feb 25th -- only Ganneff cannot attend
[16:07:55] <spectranaut> weekend of March 18th or 25th -- only Zobel cannot attend
[16:08:37] <spectranaut> how should we decide between these dates?
[16:08:43] <tbm> I think earlier is better than later so I'm for February (sorry Ganneff)
[16:08:58] <Ganneff> is ok, the second i miss.
[16:09:04] <tbm> Of course, February and March are still far away, so I'm wondering how firm people's schedule are
[16:09:20] <tbm> On the other hand, I hope this will allow people to reserve that time.
[16:09:36] <Hydroxide> I would prefer to decide the date now, or soon if we can't decide today, exactly to allow long-term planning and cheaper airfares
[16:09:38] <Ganneff> may be able to be online then, but its short after chinese new year, so pretty sure im not able to travel anywhere else than to wifes country...
[16:10:15] <tbm> I fear we won't be able to host the meeting in Taiwan :)
[16:10:23] <Ganneff> pah, its a nice place.
[16:10:28] <tbm> I'd say Canada or the US and with Ganneff not attending we may just as well go with the US
[16:10:35] <tbm> Maybe SFLC could host us again
[16:10:58] <tbm> Any objections to February 25?
[16:11:04] <tbm> I suggest a full day on Friday and Saturday
[16:11:06] <Ganneff> nope
[16:11:07] <schultmc> no objections from me
[16:11:10] <tbm> so arrival on Thursday, departure on Sunday
[16:11:12] <tbm> Does that sound ok?
[16:11:22] <tbm> That should keep airfare down
[16:11:28] <Hydroxide> great. when should we be picking the location? (at least city, no need to decide precise venue yet)
[16:11:45] <Ganneff> maybe at some point in the future i get to attend. :)
[16:11:49] <schultmc> NYC worked well last time
[16:11:49] <tbm> I can work with spectranaut on this offline
[16:11:53] <tbm> Ganneff: hopefully
[16:11:57] <Hydroxide> ok
[16:12:04] <schultmc> good air connections to .us and .eu
[16:12:07] <Ganneff> (put it in .de, makes it way easier. or .eu)
[16:12:07] <tbm> if hotel rates are reasonable in NYC in February, I can ask SFLC again
[16:12:28] <schultmc> january and february rates for NYC hotels are quite reasonable
[16:12:31] <Hydroxide> tbm: that should be as cheap of a time of year as NYC ever gets
[16:12:35] <zobel> do we need to discuss that now?
[16:12:42] <Ganneff> no
[16:12:43] <tbm> Nope, let's move that offline
[16:12:46] <spectranaut> ok, since there are no objectiongs, I'll report Feb 25 in the meetings
[16:12:46] <Hydroxide> oko
[16:13:00] <tbm> spectranaut: anything else from you?
[16:13:09] <spectranaut> nothing else from me
[16:13:16] <tbm> [item 6, Outstanding minutes]
[16:13:27] <tbm> I believe we have minutes for September 12 to approve
[16:13:28] <Hydroxide> tbm: if you decide on NYC and SFLC can't host for whatever reason, I can help look for alternate venues, since I'm now local. but SFLC would be great.
[16:13:32] <tbm> http://spi-inc.org/meetings/minutes/2016/2016-09-12/
[16:14:20] <Ganneff> go go go vote.

[16:15:30] <spectranaut_> Voting for "Meeting minutes for Monday 12 September 2016" closed.
[16:15:31] <schultmc> !vote yes
[16:15:34] <spectranaut> oops sorry!
[16:15:34] <schultmc> sorry
[16:15:40] <spectranaut> I miscounted
[16:16:05] <tbm> It's fine, you can just count schultmc's vote manually
[16:16:09] <tbm> [item 7, Items up for discussion]
[16:16:12] <tbm> [item 7.1, Directors and officers liability insurance update]
[16:16:20] <zobel> spectranaut: just get the right number into the report.
[16:16:40] <tbm> We were planning to go with the discounted quote via NPCC.
[16:16:43] <tbm> schultmc pointed out that NPCC membership is only open for organizations in New York metropolitan area
[16:16:59] <tbm> I reported last time that I contacted NPCC by email but heard not back yet
[16:16:59] <Ganneff> spectranaut: for the future, a /vote_result will just count, not directly close, as /vote_stop
[16:17:19] <tbm> As it turns out, my mail was not sent due to a configuration error. I apologize.  I sent an email today and will report next time (or by email)
[16:17:45] <tbm> (done)
[16:18:07] <schultmc> if we fix 7.3 with a NYC address we could possibly qualify for NPCC membership
[16:18:43] <tbm> They also have an "affiliate" status which might be enough.
[16:18:49] <tbm> Hopefully I'll know more next time
[16:19:01] <tbm> [item 7.2, Bylaws draft update]
[16:19:07] <tbm> Hydroxide?
[16:19:12] <Hydroxide> Unfortunately the end of a job coincided with a close family member's surgery (they're fine), so I'm a bit behind on this. I aim to jumpstart the email discussion this week on spi-general. My tentative plan is to use Bdale's draft as a template, but make amendments require a member vote quorum of 10% of the voting membership and a 50%+1 majority vote approval. the board would be able to vote normally to tri
[16:19:18] <Hydroxide> gger a member vote - 30 days advance ...
[16:19:21] <Hydroxide> ... notice, 1 week to vote. if the bylaw needs to be in effect provisionally until the members decide, we'd need unanimous board approval as an extra safeguard. 10 non-director members (threshold TBD) could propose an amendment in the same way as the board.
[16:19:48] <tbm> Hydroxide: thank you. Would be good to see progress on this soon.
[16:20:04] <Hydroxide> I don't want a hard approval threshold, but I respect the members' desire to have some oversight besides periodic board elections.
[16:20:05] --> maninvan (~bonney@S0106907240030a21.vc.shawcable.net) has joined #spi
[16:20:29] <Hydroxide> agreed, we should get this done soon and I'm happy to see it through.
[16:21:08] <tbm> Thanks
[16:21:11] <tbm> Any questions?
[16:21:35] <zobel> nope
[16:21:39] <Hydroxide> (done)
[16:21:53] <tbm> [item 7.3, Physical mailing address update]
[16:22:06] <tbm> Since Luca is not around, should we skip this or can someone else give an update?
[16:22:56] <tbm> Okay, let's add it to the November agenda
[16:23:01] <tbm> [item 7.4, Status of deprecation of SPI CA]
[16:23:03] <tbm> At the face-to-face meeting in February, we decided to deprecate the
[16:23:05] <tbm> SPI CA by the end of this year.
[16:23:07] <tbm> What is still needed to do this?
[16:23:12] <tbm> Are we on track?
[16:23:25] <Ganneff> not really done anything on it, but i gives out nothing new anymore.
[16:23:30] <Ganneff> its removed from debian (and others)
[16:23:50] <Ganneff> our own stuff that still has i switch soon, hopefully before next meeting.
[16:23:51] <tbm> Are there any users left?  I believe zobel found some back in February
[16:24:27] <zobel> oftc was
[16:24:36] <tbm> zobel: but not anymore?
[16:24:42] <zobel> not sure.
[16:24:44] <Ganneff> no
[16:24:49] <Ganneff> letsencryptified it is
[16:25:00] <zobel> db.oftc.net might be still using it.
[16:25:27] <Ganneff> ill be talking to people i see certs for.
[16:25:31] <Ganneff> brb, kid crying
[16:25:36] <tbm> Okay, thanks Ganneff
[16:25:44] <tbm> Maybe you can give an update in the November meeting
[16:25:48] <tridge> rt.spi-inc.org seems to use it?
[16:26:03] <tbm> tridge: yeah, spi still uses it, as Ganneff mentioned
[16:26:21] <tbm> [item 8, Any other business]
[16:26:25] <tbm> Anything else?
[16:26:34] <xnox> shall i post urls to the reports?
[16:26:47] -*- xnox pushed them out to my private server, until i fight with ikiwiki & html conversion? =)
[16:26:58] <zobel> yes?
[16:27:25] <zobel> tbm: ^
[16:27:54] <tbm> I suggest you take your time and get it right but maybe can a link to the board list for preview?
[16:28:02] <xnox> ok
[16:28:03] <tbm> Whatever you prefer
[16:28:09] <tbm> Anything else?
[16:28:13] <xnox> i'll send it to the board.
[16:28:16] <tbm> Sounds like there's no other business
[16:28:37] <tbm> I'll be away for 2 weeks starting on Thursday.
[16:28:39] <tbm> I'll be checking email but I'll be less active.
[16:28:41] <tbm> Just as FYI.

[16:28:47] <tbm> The next board meeting is scheduled for November 14, 2016

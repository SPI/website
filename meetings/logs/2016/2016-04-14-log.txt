10:08:25 < Noodles> So, er, if the board meeting isn't on tonight it would be nice as someone planning to attend to see some confirmation of that - I assume from Solver/linuxhiker above there's discussion on -board?

14:32:31 < Solver> I'll be turning up unless there is official notice of a change of date
14:35:02 < Solver> There was a discussion yes.  A alternative time was proposed but I haven't seen offical notice of a change.  Presumably there must be a minimum period of notice.
14:35:37 < Solver> As far as I can see the original scheduled meeting is on as planned.
15:10:16 < Noodles> Risk of non-quorum I assume?
16:30:37 < Solver> yeah.  3 probable or definite regrets at this point I believe

22:15:58 < Noodles> Hmmmm. Topic says 21:30 UTC, the date command is 20:30 UTC. Which is it? 1hr17 or 17 minutes? I was assuming the latter from the announcements / usual practise.
22:25:17 < bkerensa> Supposedly still 21:30 UTC
22:25:28 < bkerensa> but I hear it might be cancelled due to lack of quorum

23:59:00 < linuxhiker> Probably next Friday

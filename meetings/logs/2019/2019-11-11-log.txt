20:02 < schultmc> I've seen regrets from lamby and tridge
20:03 < schultmc> anyone hear from zobel, zumbi or luca?
20:04 < schultmc> pinged luca on signal
20:04 < tpot> Perhaps caught by the daylight savings change.
20:04 < Snow-Man> or figuring we're having the in-person meeting later this month...
20:05 < schultmc> pinged zobel on signal
20:08 < schultmc> doesn't look like we'll be quorate
20:08 < schultmc> we do have our in person meeting next week
20:08 < Snow-Man> yup
20:08 < schultmc> treasurer sprint followed by board meeting
20:09 < fsf> I guess I'll see y'all in a couple weeks, then!
20:10 < tpot> See you then~
20:10 < schultmc> fsf: next week :)
20:10 < schultmc> thank you for your time - see you at the f2f!
20:10 < Snow-Man> +1
20:11 < fsf> Oh snap, you're right! At least I booked plane tickets for the right days. I even got a new jacket with NYC as an excuse :D
20:11 < fsf> (Reaching middle age in California has not been kind to my cold-weather wardrobe, you see)
20:11 < schultmc> next non-f2f meeting will be 2019-12-09 at 2000 UTC - any objections?
20:11 < tbm> is everyone attending the f2f (apart from tridge)?
20:12 < fsf> No objections to 2019-12-09; I will be attending f2f
20:12 < schultmc> I booked travel for myself and lamby
20:13 < Snow-Man> I'll be at the sprint and the f2f
20:13 < tpot> I am still looking for a location for the sprint.
20:13 < Snow-Man> Dec 9 looks good for me also.
20:13 * Snow-Man is leaving for Sydney tomorrow
20:13 < schultmc> did crunchy fall through?
20:13 < Snow-Man> then back on Sunday
20:13 < Snow-Man> schultmc: it's not looking promising.
20:13 < schultmc> Snow-Man: ah
20:14 < Snow-Man> Then train up next Wednesday
20:14 < Snow-Man> and then I fly out to Madrid from Newark on Sunday
20:14 < schultmc> SPI does have funds - we can rent space if needed
20:14 < Snow-Man> fun times..
20:14 < Snow-Man> I'll follow up on our space but given that it's all day during the day...
20:15 < Snow-Man> I could host us in Washington DC, no problem. ;)
20:15 < schultmc> heh
20:16 < schultmc> *GAVEL*
20:16 < schultmc> see many of you next week - let me know if you need assistance booking space, tpot
20:17 < schultmc> other boards I'm on use space at libraries but not for 2 days of day long meetings

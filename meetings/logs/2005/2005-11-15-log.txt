07:19 <Overfiend> <Joey> Joey
07:27 <CosmicRay> how quorate are we?
07:33 <Overfiend> CR: exactly
07:42 <cdlu> CosmicRay, we had 6 out of 6 required by you walking in
07:43 <Overfiend> No Bruce, Diziet, Bdale
07:50 <Hydroxide> mako was just here, joey joined shortly before the meeting
08:06 <cdlu> joey, mako, ping!
08:14 <mako> sorry
08:15 <Hydroxide> cdlu: joey never does the name thing anyway
08:21 <mako> i'm Benjamin Mako Hill and i'm here
08:22 <cdlu> Hydroxide, he's too good for that. ;)
08:22 <Overfiend> That's why I did it for him.
08:26 <CosmicRay> cdlu: is that everyone?
08:33 <cdlu> CR, all present and accounted for.
08:38 <CosmicRay> anything urgent that we need to cover right now?
08:47 <Hydroxide> 4 treasurer's reports to approve
08:50 <Overfiend> Yes, anything to vote on, and Jimmy's report and Treas issues.
08:51 <Hydroxide> and 1 minutes
08:54 <cdlu> 4 sets of treasurer's reports, a set of minutes, and the Nessus fork are the new things to work on today
09:09 <CosmicRay> ok, let's do the nessus fork first
09:11 <Overfiend> I have already reviewed Jimmy's 4 new reports, and they look fine to me.
09:12 <Overfiend> Oh.
09:13 <CosmicRay> whose item is this?
09:21 <Overfiend> Nessus fork project membership: OpenVAS (see also openvas.org(Tim Brown ([machine]))
09:38 <cdlu> [machine], are you here?
09:41 <cdlu> he's 4.5 hours idle
09:44 <Overfiend> We'll need to shelve this if the advocate is not here to speak for it.
09:46 <Hydroxide> and also /away
09:58 <CosmicRay> ok, then let's look at treasurer business I guess.
10:00 * Overfiend moves to shelve it.
10:06 * CosmicRay tries to be fast
10:15 <cdlu> overfiend, careful, someone might second... ;)
10:29 <CosmicRay> we have some reports to approve.  I haven't had a chance to look at them yet but we could vote anyway if others are ready.
10:31 <cdlu> CosmicRay, ask for discussion/vote on 4 reports as a group?
10:38 <CosmicRay> yes
10:43 <Overfiend> cdlu: I forget, can the president unilaterally change the agenda, barring explicit objection?
10:43 <CosmicRay> is there a motion to approve all 4 reports?
10:51 * Overfiend moves to approve all 4 Treasurer reports
10:54 * mako seconds
10:54 * Hydroxide seconds
10:57 <cdlu> Overfiend, noone's ever stopped him before...
10:58 <Overfiend> as they appear at http://www.spi-inc.org/secretary/agenda/2005-11-15.html

11:58 <CosmicRay> SPI's website isn't working for me so can someone tell me what's next on the agenda
12:07 <Overfiend> CR: we should probably handle 6.1 next

12:18 <cdlu>     1. June 21st, 2005
12:20 <Hydroxide> oh yeah, minutes
12:26 <cdlu> hydroxide, try reading it from the agenda :)
12:26 <Hydroxide> that should be approved first
12:29 <Overfiend> yeah, voting on those should come first
12:34 <Overfiend> sorry
12:42 <CosmicRay> ok.  minutes.
12:43 <Hydroxide> I read the June 21st minutes before the meeting and they seem fine
13:04 <cdlu> I hope you like these minutes. The tax filing discussion gave me an ulcer.
13:15 * Overfiend moves to accept the 21 June minutes as posted at http://www.spi-inc.org/secretary/minutes/20050621.txt

14:30 <Overfiend> Only logs.
14:33 <CosmicRay> ooo, the agenda finally loaded ;-)
14:37 <cdlu> logs don't need approving :)
14:37 <Hydroxide> !vote stop
14:37 <bolt> vote result: yes. 4 yes votes, 0 no votes and 2 abstentions
14:45 <CosmicRay> ok, then let's move to tax filing and bookkeeping status
14:46 <Hydroxide> (2 abstentions, just updating that)
14:55 <Overfiend> oh damn
14:56 <cdlu> CR, the rest of the agenda, for the record:
14:56 <cdlu>     1. Tax filing and book keeping status (Jimmy)
14:56 <cdlu>     2. Debian Core Consortium related issues (Mako)
14:56 <cdlu>     3. OFTC election results (cdlu)
14:56 <cdlu>     4. Debian website copyright issues (Tommi Vainikainen) [see appendix]
14:56 <cdlu>     5. Nessus fork project membership: OpenVAS (see also openvas.org(Tim Brown ([machine]))
15:07 <CosmicRay> Hydroxide/Overfiend: did you guys see the inquiry about a receipt that I sent?
15:07 <cdlu> oh, I forgot to take OFTC election results off there
15:08 <Overfiend> nevermind
15:15 <CosmicRay> I seem to have sent it to board twice but I can't recall seeing it at all
15:18 <tupawk> i am here to represent OpenVAS, missed the role call for [machine]
15:23 <Hydroxide> CosmicRay: when? there is SPI mail blockage
15:28 <Overfiend> CosmicRay: I did, and I believe I have it in the batch of September donations
15:36 <CosmicRay> tupawk: we'll get back to you in a sec, thanks
15:43 <Hydroxide> ah, ok. see Overfiend then :)
15:47 <CosmicRay> Overfiend: will you reply to her or should I tell her something?
16:06 <Overfiend> CosmicRay: I will reply.  Nagging encouraged until you see a CC
16:10 <Overfiend> But I plan to do it today.
16:18 <CosmicRay> Overfiend: excellent
16:21 <CosmicRay> thanks
16:23 <Overfiend> That plan often fails for me, but it *is* the plan.
16:26 <CosmicRay> heh
16:39 <CosmicRay> anything else on the bookkeeping stuff?  I saw a mail snafu got sorted out...
16:39 <Overfiend> Also, everyone should know
16:50 <Overfiend> Yes, there was a SNAFU with the documents mailed to MBS
16:53 <Overfiend> that for once was not my fault
17:06 <Overfiend> MBS claimed not to get the notice of certified mail delivery
17:12 <Overfiend> it was delivered on 22 Oct but they didn't pick it up until yesterday
17:16 <Overfiend> Frank said they'd work on it immediately
17:17 <CosmicRay> heh
17:22 <Hydroxide> Overfiend: we should ask him to clarify what address we should use, which might or might not be correct
17:22 <Overfiend> so I will pass along an update as soon as I have one
17:26 <Overfiend> Hydroxide: I did.
17:29 <Overfiend> I used the right one.
17:30 <Hydroxide> Overfiend: okay
17:34 <Overfiend> Someone in NY just dropped the ball.
17:44 <Hydroxide> not a good sign for a bookkeeping service, but hopefully it won't keep happening
17:48 <Hydroxide> it could have been the USPS screwup, too
17:53 <Hydroxide> so it might not be MBS's fault either
17:56 <Overfiend> Frank was *very* fast to respond, and to pick it up
18:08 <Overfiend> I mailed him at, like 1530 EST and they had gone to get it by the end of the day
18:11 <Hydroxide> yeah. we can blame USPS and not worry too much :)
18:23 <Overfiend> if it was their fuck up, they clean up really nice.
18:46 <Overfiend> anyway, that's it on that front AFAIK
18:57 <Overfiend> I am pokey to make deposits and am eager for MBS to take this over.
19:18 <Overfiend> it makes our income look way more erratic on the Treas reports than it really is.
19:34 <CosmicRay> ok, thanks for the update.  anything else on that?
19:37 <Overfiend> No.
19:46 <mako> i'm about to turn into a pumpkin
19:51 <Overfiend> Jimmy too.
19:53 <CosmicRay> OK.  Let's skip to 6.5 really fast
19:53 <cdlu> as is jimmy
20:06 <CosmicRay> tupawk: this is you
20:06 <Overfiend> Nessus fork project membership: OpenVAS (see also openvas.org(Tim Brown ([machine]))
20:17 <CosmicRay> I think we have talked to you a bit about this already, right?
20:21 <tupawk> correct
20:32 <Overfiend> If we lose voting ability b/c we become inquorate, we can vote via email, or shelve until the Dec meeting if OpenVAS is not time-critical.
20:33 <CosmicRay> does anyone on the board have additional questions?
20:47 <CosmicRay> or are we ready to approve the request?
20:48 * Overfiend surfs to openvas.org
20:56 <cdlu> noone's written a resolution for it yet afaik, but I have no objections or further questions
21:06 <CosmicRay> Overfiend: if you follow the link from the agenda, he covers the basics that we've talked about already
21:18 <Overfiend> right
21:31 <CosmicRay> cdlu: We could always just move to accept them as a member project and pass a more formal resolution next month.
21:41 <cdlu> CR, so moved.
21:46 * Overfiend seconds
21:56 <CosmicRay> this vote is to accept openvas as a SPI member project.

22:46 <Hydroxide> yay
22:47 <CosmicRay> thanks tupawk, and sorry for being so hurried today
22:52 <CosmicRay> mako: any DCC comments?
22:53 <tupawk> np, thank all of you
22:57 <CosmicRay> (moving back to 6.2)
23:01 <mako> CosmicRay: nothing from me no
23:17 <CosmicRay> ok, if there's nothing to discuss on the DCC side, then on to 6.3 and cdlu
23:18 <Overfiend> mako: should it be dropped from the agenda until further notice?
23:52 <cdlu> CR, 6.3 is left over from last month's agenda, I don't think there's anything new to say there yet.
23:57 <CosmicRay> ok.
23:57 * cdlu forgot to remove it
23:58 * Overfiend has not heard any further complains about DCC in a while, and has not heard of any from dondelelcaro
24:07 <Overfiend> ah, good.
24:13 <CosmicRay> then we have the debian website copyright iddue, 6.4
24:14 <cdlu> oh, on the DCC front, I posted an article about it to NewsForge
24:18 <cdlu> after bugging everyone I could think of about it
24:22 <CosmicRay> heh
24:30 <Hydroxide> afk now ... bye all
24:32 <Overfiend> This issue has been reported as a bug, please see:
24:35 <Joey> Congrats tupawk
24:36 <Overfiend> the mail appears to be truncated there
24:45 <Overfiend> right, where are my manners?
24:46 <cdlu> <URL: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=238245 >
24:49 <Overfiend> tupawk: welcome aboard!
24:53 <CosmicRay> tupawk: thank you for showing up today, again my apologies for trying to squeeze 60 minutes o fmeeting into 15 ;-)
25:01 <cdlu> hehe
25:09 <Overfiend> Let us please draft a proper resolution welcoming OpenVAS to the SPI family for the next meeting.
25:12 <CosmicRay> ... and for being late myself.
25:14 <CosmicRay> yes.
25:23 <luk> who makes sure that the Projects page on the website is updated?
25:28 <Overfiend> We can use the TeXmacs one as a boilerplate.
25:32 <CosmicRay> Overfiend: do you know, is there consensus within debian to adjust the copyright to a different license?
25:39 <cdlu> luk, not sure, actually.
25:43 <mako> alright, i need to run
25:45 <Overfiend> CosmicRay: Not AFAIK.
25:46 <mako> apologies everyone
25:46 <CosmicRay> luk: nobody, unfortunately,  would you like to?
25:51 <mako> Overfiend: yeah, lets drop it until further knowledge
25:54 <CosmicRay> thanks mako
25:54 <Overfiend> CosmicRay: er, well.  I think there is consensus to change it.
25:55 <cdlu> mako, thanks for coming. have fun.. wherever it is you're going. :)
26:07 <mako> sorry to run
26:07 <Overfiend> CosmicRay: But not on what to change it to.
26:09 <luk> CosmicRay: ok, I can do that
26:11 <CosmicRay> Overfiend: I'd be in favor of following the Debian consensus, and not touching it until then
26:14 <Overfiend> CosmicRay: Some people I've spoken to were hoping the revised GNU FDL would be ready by now.
26:15 <CosmicRay> luk: great, thanks much
26:29 <luk> is the Projects page actually up to date now (except for openvas)?
26:32 <Overfiend> CosmicRay: sounds reasonable.
26:36 <Overfiend> luk: I believe so.
26:40 <cdlu> CR, want to adjourn until December 20th, or do we have more business?
26:57 <CosmicRay> cdlu: well, let's talk about that date.  a lot of people are on vacation already that time
27:06 <cdlu> including myself
27:07 <Overfiend> should we move it back 1 week?
27:08 <cdlu> want to go earlier?
27:10 <CosmicRay> shall we try to have a meeting anyway, or just give up now and go for january
27:15 <Overfiend>    December 2005
27:15 <Overfiend> Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa

27:19 <cdlu> overfiend, to the 27th?
27:20 <Overfiend> 25 26 27 28 29 30 31
27:25 <CosmicRay> one week earlier would probably be better than one week later
27:26 <cdlu> or forwrad to the 13th?
27:28 <Overfiend> the 27th is not earlier than the 20th :)
27:31 <CosmicRay> shoot for the 13th then?
27:43 * Overfiend likes the 13th.
27:47 <cdlu> well, I'm all for the 13th.
27:49 <CosmicRay> me too.
27:53 <cdlu> ok
27:57 <Joey> 13th fine atm
28:06 <CosmicRay> ok, is seems that we have unanimous consent for the next meeting to be Dec. 13 at 19:00 UTC
28:06 <cdlu> ok
28:09 <CosmicRay> is there any other business?
28:13 <cdlu> nothing here
28:15 * Overfiend has none.
28:18 * cdlu is almost CF-DLU
28:19 <CosmicRay> we are adjourned until Dec. 13.

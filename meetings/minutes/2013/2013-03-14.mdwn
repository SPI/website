## Any other business

OFTC had asked for a suitable SSL cert to allow them to provide a web
based IRC interface. There was some discussion about the need of
associated projects for SSL certs in general (for example Debian require
a number for different services/hosts, but other projects were thought
to be able to make use of such a service). Jimmy suggested that we might
want to investigate the possibility of an SPI intermediate CA that would
enable us to provide certificates for associated projects easily. Bdale
and Joerg suggested they would go and check out how much this was likely
to cost overall. A vote was taken allowing them to at least purchase a
certificate for OFTC and potentially enter into an intermediate CA
relationship if they deemed it appropriate.

"Bdale and Joerg investigate a StartSSL Intermediate CA for SPI, with
suitable discount pricing. If they both are okay with going forward,
they're authorized to do so. They're also authorized to get OFTC <= 10
individual certs in the next 90 days as needed."

## President's Report

Bdale was pleased to have been able to review and comment on Bradley

needs of NPOs like SPI. He also noted he had submitted a request for an
SPI BOF to the DebConf 13 organizers.

funds, transfer of OBF funds to SPI, and receipt of LibreOffice advisory
board funds.  He hadn't yet heard back from the local bookkeeping firm.

## Any other business

There was some discussion about the fact that the Open Voting Foundation
website had disappeared and been replaced with a SEO site. As a minimum
it was agreed we'd remove the link to the no longer active site, but the
larger concern of what to do about projects that were no longer active
was brought up. This potentially applies to OSUNIX and Path64 as well.

The SFC accounting software proposal was also discussed, with a
suggestion that SPI would contribute $10,000 towards the effort.
Agreement on this was not reached, but it was agreed we'd probably want
to get involved in the process of defining the needs of NPOs such as SPI
and that we should revisit the topic of donating after some further
investigation.

## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Thursday, June 13th, 2013 at 20:00
UTC in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.

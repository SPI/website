Michael informed the board that he had been in contact with Foster
Results (a local to him firm) and Human Bookkeeping (based in
Massachusetts) about bookkeeping services for SPI. He'd had a reply from
Human Bookkeeping suggesting a $579 fee for catching up with our current
status and an ongoing monthly fee of $431. This compared to a rough
quote of $360-$720/month from the bookkeeper used by PostgreSQL Experts.

Michael was still waiting to hear back from Foster Results, but he
expected to be able to make a decision about the best option once he had
done so. There was some discussion about how to proceed and it was felt
that Michael should be authorized to proceed with hiring whichever
bookkeeper he felt suited our needs best, subject to some spending
limits.

Vote on Authorize the treasurer to commit to expenditure of up to $1500
catch up, $750 monthly to cover hiring a fully bonded and insured
bookkeeper to aid in the treasurer's duties.

## Any other business

Robert mentioned that the last piece of the Debian audit was still
hanging around. It was unclear to him what was still required so he'd
asked Debian for clarification. Lucas was on channel and indicated that
he believe the additional notes providing some clarification on the
transactions should be on the bank statements. Robert said he'd take a
second look and ask if he needed further information.

Jimmy asked if Josh Berkus was around to comment on what was happening
with the SFC donation for accounting software. He wasn't, but Michael
stated that LibreOffice had donated $500 to the SFC for this purpose.

## Secretary's report

Jonathan stated that we'd had some contact from a Canadian charity who

## Items up for discussion

### SPI as legal entity for DebConf 14 (Portland, OR)

The DebConf 14 organisation team had been in contact to request that SPI
act as the legal entity for that event; potentially being involved in signing
venue contracts etc. This was done in a similar fashion for DebConf New York,
so it was expected that there would be no problem with this. Jonathan said
he'd contact Michael to ensure it was ok from the treasurer point of view.


## Any other business

It was asked if we'd heard back from legal counsel about the donation to SFC.
It was stated that there was not a huge rush on the donation so although a
reply had not been received yet there was no need to push for a swift
response.


## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Thursday, November 14th, 2013 at 20:00 UTC
in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.

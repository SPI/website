These are the minutes for the September 12th, 2013 SPI Board Meeting,
held at 20:00 UTC in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.
[LOG](../../../logs/2013/2013-09-12-log.txt). It was abandoned without
presenting any reports or taking any votes due to failing to make quorum.

## Any other business

Although the meeting did not reach quorum Josh Berkus wanted to raise
his concerns about the time it was taking to get routine SPI paperwork
approved. Some discussion ensued and it was felt that the only
outstanding issue was the grant to the SFC for accounting software
development, which had been referred to legal counsel to comment on.


## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Thursday, October 10th, 2013 at 20:00 UTC
in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.

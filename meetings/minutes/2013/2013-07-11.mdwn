These are the minutes for the July 11th, 2013 SPI Board Meeting,
held at 20:00 UTC in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.
[LOG](../../../logs/2013/2013-07-11-log.txt).


## President's Report

Bdale informed us that his home had been destroyed by the fires in Black
Forest, Colorado. He and his family have been making progress and have
found an apartment to live in while they rebuild their home. This had
caused some understandable distraction from SPI business.


## Treasurer's report

<pre>
This report uses a cash-based method of accounting, recording donations
when deposited (not when the check was written or received by us) and
recording expenses when sent or scheduled for payment (not when
incurred).

Michael had received a quote of $439/month for bookkeeping services from
Human Bookkeeping and was in the process of answering some final
questions from Foster Results. He hoped to have a quote from them
shortly. Martin added the information that he had identified all Debian
bookings from January 2010 until March 2012. Joshua indicated that our
incoming donation rate was rising more rapidly than project expenditure
and it might be wise to ensure that projects were making use of their
donations fully rather than hoarding cash.


## Secretary's report

Jonathan reported that the board elections were open for a further 2.5
days and that 3 nominations had been received for the 4 open positions.
He also indicated that while he had not yet prepared an annual report
for this year he planned to do so, and that rather than continue to wait
for the final pieces of last years he would publish what he already had.

Motion passed with a vote of 5 yes, 4 abstain, 0 missing.


## Items up for discussion

### Resolution 2013-06-30.jmd.1: Swathanthra Malayalam Computing as an associated project

The vote on this was abandoned due to concerns from Joshua. It was
suggested that an email vote would be attempted so that SMC could
make use of SPI for their Google Summer of Code payments.


## Any other business

Bdale mentioned that his request for an SPI BoF at DebConf had been
accepted. Several board members indicated they would attend via IRC
where possible.

Robert mentioned that the last piece of the Debian audit was still
hanging around. It was unclear to him what was still required so he'd
asked Debian for clarification. Lucas was on channel and indicated that
he believe the additional notes providing some clarification on the
transactions should be on the bank statements. Robert said he'd take a
second look and ask if he needed further information.

Jimmy asked if Josh Berkus was around to comment on what was happening
with the SFC donation for accounting software. He wasn't, but Michael
stated that LibreOffice had donated $500 to the SFC for this purpose.


## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Thursday, August 8th, 2013 at 20:00 UTC
in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.

## Update from members committee

Since no report was filed this agenda item was postponed.

## Branden's reappointment

Resolution
[2004-01-06.jrk.1.br.1](/corporate/resolutions/2004/2004-01-06.jrk.1.br.1/)
replaced Branden Robinson with Jimmy Kaplowitz as treasurer but did not
explicitly remove Branden from the board of directors. Ean declared that as
president he was willing to accept legal responsibility for allowing Branden on
the board until elections can be held for his position. David proposed
resolution 2004-03-02.db1.1 to appoint Branden to the board of directors as an
interim member until the next annual meeting.  Ian seconded the motion and Ean
called for a vote:

<table><tbody>
    <tr><td>Branden</td>	<td>abstains</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bruce</td>		<td>in favour</td></tr>
    <tr><td>David</td>		<td>in favour</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ean</td>		<td>in favour</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ian</td>		<td>in favour</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Jimmy</td>		<td>in favour</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Joey</td>		<td>abstains</td></tr>
    <tr><td>John</td>		<td>in favour</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Mako</td>		<td>in favour</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

The resolution is accepted with seven votes in favour and none against.

## Suspension of by-laws vote

Since SPI's legal council noticed some possible problems with the proposed
new by-laws Branden proposed resolution 2004.03.02.meeting.1 to suspend
the active by-laws vote until legal counsel has fully reviewed the
proposals. Ean called for a vote:

<table><tbody>
    <tr><td>Branden</td>	<td>abstains</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bruce</td>		<td>in favour</td></tr>
    <tr><td>David</td>		<td>in favour</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ean</td>		<td>in favour</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ian</td>		<td>in favour</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Jimmy</td>		<td>in favour</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Joey</td>		<td>in favour</td></tr>
    <tr><td>John</td>		<td>abstains</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Mako</td>		<td>in favour</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

The resolution is accepted with eight votes in favour and none against. Ean
asked who will take the lead in working with Chris Rourk to review and
reintroduce the by-laws changes. David promised the by-laws committee
would take care of this.

## wxWidgets

Ian proposed resolution
[2004-03-02.iwj.1](/corporate/resolutions/2004/2004-03-02.iwj.1/)
to adopt the wxWidgets project. Mako asked if anyone would volunteer as a
contact person for wxWidgets until they knew their way around SPI and added he
would be happy to do this himself. Ean called for a vote:

<table><tbody>
    <tr><td>Branden</td>	<td>abstains</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bruce</td>		<td>in favour</td></tr>
    <tr><td>David</td>		<td>in favour</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ean</td>		<td>in favour</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ian</td>		<td>in favour</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Jimmy</td>		<td>in favour</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Joey</td>		<td>in favour</td></tr>
    <tr><td>John</td>		<td>abstains</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Mako</td>		<td>in favour</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

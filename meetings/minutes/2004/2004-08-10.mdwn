Resolution
[2004-08-10.iwj.dbg.3](/corporate/resolutions/2004/2004-08-10.iwj.dbg.3):
Board Advisors.

This resolution supersedes:
[2003-07-26.bmh.1](/corporate/resolutions/2003/2003-07-26.bmh.1/),
[2002-05-07.mgs.3.br](/corporate/resolutions/2002/2002-05-07.mgs.3.br/),
[2001-05-16.nl](/corporate/resolutions/2001/2001-05-16.nl/),
[1999-08-12.iwj.1](/corporate/resolutions/1999/1999-08-12.iwj.1/) &
[1998-09-25.nl.1](/corporate/resolutions/1998/1998-09-25.nl.1/).

Discussion:

* Joseph Nahmias inquired as to the purpose of Advisors.
* Ian Jackson explained that Advisors have no power, but do have influence and
  can see what the Board is doing.
* Branden Robinson pointed out that if the Board is deceptive, the Advisors can
  report this fact to member projects.
* Bdale Garbee stated that as an advisor, he felt his role was to make a pain
  of himself on issues the board was not adequately addressing.
* Martin Schulze suggested that the resolution include text saying that the
  removal of a projected-appointed advisor should be explicitly an exception,
  or have its need defined.
* Ian Jackson proposed an amendment (see below).
* Branden Robinson noted that the purpose of the paragraph in the first place
  is to allow the board to remove a disruptive advisor over the wishes of a
  member project.
* Bruce Perens forced a call to vote on the amendment.

Ian Jackson proposed an amendment to paragraph 7:

<pre>
7. The SPI Board reserves the right to vary the number of
   Representative Advisor seats it offers to a particular Associated
   Project. The SPI Board also reserves the right to reject,
   remove, or replace a Project's nominee(s), should the need arise.
</pre>

The amendment would replace "should the need arise" with "(but the Board
hopes not to feel the need to do so)".

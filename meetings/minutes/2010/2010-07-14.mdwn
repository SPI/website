## Secretary's report

The annual board election failed to produce more candidates than
positions available, so there was no vote required. The 4 re-elected
board members (Bdale, Joerg, Joshua and Martin) are congratulated.

Joshua Drake pointed out that
<a href="https://www.postgresqlconference.org/">PostgreSQL Conference West</a>
had been announced and the Call For Papers was out.

Robert Brockway enquired about the fact that of 5 vacant seats only 4
had been filed; this takes the board down to 8 seats, which is the
minimum our bylaws allow.

There was some discussion about treating Debian and DebConf
separately, or at least providing details of money held for DebConf as a
line item within the Debian holding. It was pointed out DebConf is not
an SPI project and thus from our perspective it's all Debian's. There
were discussions around this topic already planned for DebConf.

Joe Nahmias expressed some concern at the poor rate of interest SPI
is receiving on assets that it holds. Michael Schultheiss said he would
research higher yield accounts.

## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Wednesday, August 11th, 2010 at 20:00
UTC in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.

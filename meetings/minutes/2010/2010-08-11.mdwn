## Secretary's report

Jonathan reported he'd taken a brief look at moving the website to
ikiwiki while at DebConf, but failed to easily export the current content
from Plone to enable this. This spurred a little discussion about other
options, including Joshua suggesting he might find time to look at
Drupal.

## Any other business

The Debian Project Leader had asked about the possibility of "sustaining
membership", involving being able to make regular donations. Michael stated
that our payment processors already allowed us to take recurrent charges
and suggested we might want some sort of status badge or other
acknowledgement.

debian.eu was also brought up, and Jonathan agreed to take a look at
drafting an initial letter to the current owner.

## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Wednesday, September 8th, 2010 at 20:00

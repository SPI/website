at 20:00 UTC in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org. [LOG](../../../logs/2010/2010-05-19-log.txt)


## President's Report

I'm thrilled to report that we have a working arrangement by which SPI
associated projects (and other worthwhile projects like kernel.org) can obtain
a deep discount on server and storage hardware from HP.  The process we ended
up with is *not* the one we started out trying to make work...  Rather than
resolve the issues we raised with having SPI sign the standard partner
contract, since we didn't really want the "other benefits" that motivated most
of the unpleasant-to-us contract terms, the HP server business unit instead
proposed to just give us the same discount directly.  This is a wonderful
result, and orders have already been placed by SPI on behalf of Debian and by
kernel.org under the new process.  Any SPI associated project that wants to
take advantage of this should send me an email requesting details on how to
start the process.


## Treasurer's Report

Michael Schultheiss provided the following financial reports for
April 2010:

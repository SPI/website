## President's Report

Bdale reports that he and Jonathan had started work on long discussed
replacement for the SPI website, based on ikiwiki, git + markdown. The
new structure is licensed CC-by-SA 3.0 and there's enough there to be
able to get an idea of where we're going.

## Secretary's report

Jonathan reported he had had contact from spi-trademark about adopting
[http://wiki.mako.cc/TrademarkFreedom](http://wiki.mako.cc/TrademarkFreedom),
but that it was largely directed towards the DPL (and other individual
projects) rather than SPI itself.

## Any other business

David mentioned that OFTC were in the midst of their annual elections.
Jonathan pointed out that
[PgWest](https://www.postgresqlconference.org/) was on at the start of
November. Bdale commented that he'd spoken to Bradley Kuhn of the
conservancy and congratulated him on his soon-to-be paid exec director
role there. The relationship between SPI and the conservancy is good and
both parties wish to keep it that way and point projects at whichever is
the better "hosting organisation".

## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Wednesday, November 10th, 2010 at 20:00
UTC in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.

## Appendix B: Resolutions

### 2010-10-11.jmd.1: Recognition of sidux name change

<pre>
WHEREAS

 1. sidux is an existing associated SPI project (as per 2009-11-27.jmd.2)

 2. sidux has parted ways with sidux e.V. and as a result renamed the
    project to aptosid to avoid issues over the sidux name.

 3. The aptosid development team remains unchanged from sidux and the
    sidux website indicates that the renaming has taken place.

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

 3. SPI recognises the name change of the sidux project from aptosid
    and will update its records accordingly.

 4. Ferdinand Thommes continues to be recognised as the current
    authoritative decision maker and SPI liaison for aptosid. In the event
    of the liaison becoming unavailable Trevor Walkley will act as temporary
    liaison and notify SPI of any replacement liaison.

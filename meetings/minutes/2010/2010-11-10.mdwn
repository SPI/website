## Secretary's report

Jonathan indicated that he'd like some extra eyes to look over the new website
looking for missing pieces or inaccuracies. He stated that there were a few
missing pieces that he felt should be resolved before we were ready for
switchover. These included details on becoming a member or associated project
and details of where the git repo for the website lived.

## Items up for discussion

### Timing of future meetings (move to 20:30 UTC?)

The recent change from daylight savings time in the northern hemisphere has
resulted in the 20:00 UTC becoming less convenient for some board members,
while working better for others. It was decided that we would try moving to
20:30 UTC as a compromise to see if that suited all board members equally well.

## Any other business

David mentioned that OFTC had completed their annual elections and had largely
retained the status quo, with tjfontaine remaining project leader and David as
Ombudsman. He also commented that the project had voted 100% in favour of
remaining with SPI.

Joshua reported that [PgWest](https://www.postgresqlconference.org/) had seen a
90% increase in attendance.

Martin reported that Joerg had signed and sent the letter to the current holder
of debian.eu, requesting it be handed over to the Debian project. No response
has been received yet but it was suggested a further month be allowed before
initiating the EURid ADR process.

## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Wednesday, December 8th, 2010 at 20:30
UTC in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.

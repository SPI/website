There had been a query on the list about the refund listed under expenses;
Michael clarified that it was a refund of an attendance fee for DebConf10 for
someone who ended up unable to attend. Michael also reported that our NY state
charity documentation had been mailed off.


## Secretary's report

Jonathan reported that he'd added a few remaining pages to the new website that
he felt were important to have, and Joerg had made the switch to enable it the
day before the meeting. It's accepted there are still some content that needs
to be moved from the old site, but felt that the new site is now the more
complete of the two.

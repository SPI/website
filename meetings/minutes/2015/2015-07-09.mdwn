and any related actions; and

### Resolution 2015-06-11.jdd.mcs.2: Sponsorship of travel to PostgreSQL conference in Cuba

<pre>
WHEREAS

   other non-conference activities;

   c. The conference must not promote tourism in Cuba.

2. PostgreSQL.org's liaison or his designee must maintain sufficient
records to be able to demonstrate compliance after the fact with these
terms (i.e. maintaining documents concerning the conference purpose,
which are standard, and being able to show both the travel itineraries
and the daily activities schedules of attendees, from normal business
sources.)

3. It approves a financial sponsorship of travel to the conference based
on the limitations set forth.

4. Recipients of travel sponsorship to the PostgreSQL conference in Cuba
are required to sign a sworn affidavit that they will not violate any of
the above requirements.

These are the minutes for the May 14th, 2015 SPI Board Meeting,
held at 20:30 UTC in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.
[LOG](../../../logs/2015/2015-05-14-log.txt).


## President's Report

Bdale Garbee has started investigating whether it makes sense for SPI to
enter into a contract with a third-party management organization for key
office and financial services, similarly to what the CELF Board did a few
years ago.


## Treasurer's report

Michael Schultheiss has published the March and April treasurer's reports.
He thanked the Craigslist Foundation for their generous donation of $50,000
($25,000 to SPI and $25,000 to PostgreSQL).  The Debian Project also
received a $20,000 donation from a periodic donor.

Martin Michlmayr asked whether an extension for the tax return had been
filed because it would otherwise be due on May 15th.  Michael confirmed
that an extension had been applied for and that SPI's 990 would be filed by
August 15th.

Martin Michlmayr asked whether 990 tax forms for previous years could be
added to the web site and Michael promised to add them.


## Secretary's report

Martin Michlmayr has updated the trademark page and completed the
outstanding minutes.

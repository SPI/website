[LOG](../../../logs/2005/2005-10-18-log.txt)


## President's report

None presented.


## Treasurer's report

The treasurer's report was sent after the meeting and is included in the
appendix for historical purposes.


## Outstanding minutes

None presented.


## Debian Core Consortium issues

Branden Robinson states: "I would just like to say that I'd like Don to get
Greg Pomerantz's opinion as to whether we are failing to act aggressively
enough to defend our mark.  That we have been in regular contact with DCCA and
expressing our concerns would, I think, mean we are attentive to the mark.  Is
it actually necessary to threaten DCCA with a lawsuit for a typical court to
regard us as "defending" it?"

Negotiator Don Armstrong indicates his primary task is done with DCCA having
changed their name. He notes the remaining issues are: the logo and making some
sort of announcement to clarify the relationship between the two organizations


## OFTC election results

David Graham reports that the "status quo won a resounding victory". OFTC's
voters voted unanimously in favour of a continued relationship with SPI and the
administration is essentially the same as it was going into the vote.


## Debian website copyright issues (Tommi Vainikainen)

An effort is underway to relicense the text of the Debian website which may
require the cooperation of all those who have contributed text.

A debate ensues about what is needed but the discussion is ultimately referred
to Debian to resolve.


## Adjournment

The meeting is adjourned until November 15th at 19:00 UTC.

==============================================

This report uses a cash-based method of accounting,
recording donations when deposited (not when the check was
written or received by us) and recording expenses when sent
or scheduled for payment (not when incurred). Network for
Good processing fees are no longer listed, both to avoid
confusion and since they are already subtracted out from our
check before we ever receive it.

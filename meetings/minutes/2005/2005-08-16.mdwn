## President's report

No president's report was delivered.


## Debian Core Consortium issues

This issue is discussed out of order.

Benjamin Mako Hill states, "some folks in debian are concerned about the use of
the word Debian in the name DCC Alliance which is a recent debian based project
by Progeny and a whole bunch of others"

It is noted that decisions relating to the trademark of Debian are made by the
Debian Project Leader, who, at this time, is an employee of a company starting
the DCC.

Branden Robinson assures all that no conflict exists as Progeny has made no
request of him and he is ensuring any decisions are well vetted within Debian.

Some question is brought up as to why DCC's name is an issue. Greg Pomerantz,
legal counsel, notes that:

<pre>
  DCC still stands for "Debian Common Core"
  So, they are using the name to create a product that appears to be a part of
  Debian (unlike DebianHelp etc. which are discussion fora, not operating
  systems)
</pre>

The discussion continues for another 20 minutes with the conclusion that the
Board needs to monitor the situation.

This report uses a cash-based method of accounting,
recording donations when deposited (not when the check was
written or received by us) and recording expenses when sent

confusion and since they are already subtracted out from our
check before we ever receive it. The specifics of the income

[1] According to our online banking information, $2,813.80 of this was
withdrawn from our account in July and $5,927.90 of this was withdrawn in
August. All of these reimbursements were distributed as US checks during
DebConf5 (quite an improvement from past years!), and so are listed in the
July report in accordance with the paragraph at the top of this message.
Bookkeeping update:
Quick update on the bookkeeping situation: Mako has now sent me and
Branden the new client checklist, which I will forward to the Board in a
separate mail. Branden will work on locating the needed documents (which
would be in his possession) within the next week or so, and he'll let me
know about any that are missing.
I happen, coincidentally, to be going to NYC later this week, and Mako
and I took advantage of this opportunity to have a three-way in-person
meeting with Frank of Mark's Bookkeeping on Friday the 19th. There we
will hand over the signed letter of engagement and the $1000 deposit
check, as well as those few relevant documents that are in my
possession, and try to set up mechanisms to pass data back and forth
between Mark's and SPI.
I expect that Branden will mail the relevant documents in his possession
to Mark's within the next several weeks, although we'll see what is
discussed on Friday. All in all, things seem like they are about to
start moving forward in a useful way.
Here's what we need to mail (if they are at all applicable):
1) Filing Receipt of Business
   - Type of Business i.e. Corporation, Partnership, LLC, and/or Sole
     Proprietorship
   - Confirmation of S Corporation (if any) from State and Federal
2) Proof of Federal Tax ID# - (may use a confirmed copy of SS-4,
   letter from IRS, 8109 coupon)
3) Employer Registration number and rate if this has been assigned by
   the Dept. of Labor
4) Copy of Sales Tax Certificate
5) Copy of Federal, State and City Tax Returns i.e., income tax, sales
   tax, and payroll tax
6) Bank Account(s) Information including on-line access
7) Credit Card Account(s) Information including on-line access
8) If outside payroll service is used - including payroll journals
10) Client Information (name, address, phone, open balances, terms)
11) Vendor Information (name, address, phone open balances, terms)
12) Inventory List of packing slips and invoices for inventory
13) Physical Inventory On-Hand Count (Actual Manual Count)
  6-7: Should also include bank statements for all periods that should
       be worked on.

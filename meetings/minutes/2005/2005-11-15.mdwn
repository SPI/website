Software in the Public Interest Financial Data
==============================================

This report uses a cash-based method of accounting,
recording donations when deposited (not when the check was
written or received by us) and recording expenses when sent
or scheduled for payment (not when incurred). Network for
Good processing fees are no longer listed, both to avoid
confusion and since they are already subtracted out from our
check before we ever receive it. We now have Q3 2005 data
for our Ameriprise Financial account (with income from the
RVS Cash Management fund)[1], which is included in October's
report despite it covering a period of three months.

[1] Ameriprise Financial used to be American Express Financial Advisors. The
RVS Cash Management Fund used to be the AXP Cash Management Fund. Aren't
corporate spin-offs fun?

[2] This is current as of October 13, the closing date of our most recent
Ameriprise statement, and covers the period from July 14 through then.

[3] Again, keep in mind that the lack of donations listed only means we did
not deposit any donations in October, not that we received none. Reread the
first paragraph of this report if this is unclear.

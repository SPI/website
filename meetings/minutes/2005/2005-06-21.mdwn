These are the draft minutes for the June 21st, 2005 Board meeting, held at

## President's update (John Goerzen)

John Goerzen stated

<pre>
"The annual meeting is coming up on July 1.  I will be
releasing the SPI annual report for that date.  I have received very few
contributions thus far, and would still appreciate anything that people
may have to contribute.  Also, at the first board meeting after July 1 (or
the first one after elections, should we hold them), the Board will need
to appoint the officers for the coming year."
</pre>


## Treasurer's report (Jimmy Kaplowitz)

Jimmy Kaplowitz referred to the reports attached in the appendices to these
minutes.

Moved by David Graham, seconded by Branden Robinson, a motion to approve
the Treasurer's Reports as delivered was voted on:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Jimmy Kaplowitz</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>David Graham</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bruce Perens</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>John Goerzen</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ian Jackson</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Branden Robinson</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Benj. Mako Hill</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The Treasurer's Reports for April and May 2005 were approved by a vote of:

Yes: 7, No: 0, Abstain: 0, Did not vote: 0.


## Outstanding Minutes (David Graham)

No minutes were presented.


## Items up for discussion

### Tax Filing Status (Jimmy Kaplowitz/Benj. Mako Hill)

Benj. Mako Hill explained that there are two main issues with bookkeeping.

The first issue is ensuring that we're caught up on this year's paperwork.
Hill recommends sending everything with a number on it to Mark's Book
Keeping every 1-2 weeks. They can produce monthly reports for us and
produce the paperwork needed for an accountant to do SPI's taxes. Member
project information would need to be separated out. SPI would still be
responsible for writing and depositing its own cheques.

Branden Robinson noted that sending all paperwork to Mark's as well as
depositing and writing cheques himself does not make his life any easier.

Further discussion centered around having Mark's deposit and cut SPI's
cheques on behalf of SPI.

Motion 2005-06-21.jrk.1, moved by Jimmy Kaplowitz, seconded by Benj. Mako
Hill and Branden Robinson authorises $1000 of SPI funds to pay Mark's
Book Keeping a downpayment on future activity relating to on-going and
tax-related paperwork.

<table>

<tr><td>Branden Robinson</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Jimmy Kaplowitz</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>John Goerzen</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Benj. Mako Hill</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ian Jackson</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>David Graham</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bruce Perens</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Motion 2005-06-21.jrk.1 was approved by a vote of:

Yes: 7, No: 0, Abstain: 0, Did not vote: 0.


### Membership Committee Membership

John Goerzen reports that Graham Wilson, Luk Claes, and Michael
Schultheiss have volunteered to staff this committee.


### Additional items

Branden Robinson reported that SPI received "an invoice dated 2005-06-09
from Corporation Service Company.

<pre>
If you recall, this is our new Registered Agent in New York State...
We were expecting to be invoiced sooner.
A Registered Agent is where service of process (legal subpoenas,
notices of lawsuit, etc.) go. The invoice is for USD 171.20. Unless [Jimmy
Kaplowitz] would rather take care of it, I'd like authorization to pay it
out of the general fund. We were waived the "state fee" and "service fee -
file change of agent" and received a "20% discount." Without those, the
total would have been +55+90+42.80" more."
</pre>


As per resolution 2004-10-04.bmh.1, this fee is approved and Branden
Robinson will pay it.


### Annual Meeting

The Annual Meeting must be held on the 1st of every July. The meeting is
set for July 1st, 2005 at 19:00 UTC.

David Graham states that there are no board members up for election at
this year's Annual Meeting, however the board is required to select its
officers from among its ranks. As such anyone interested in an officer
position from the board should advise the board list prior to the Annual
Meeting.

The next monthly Board meeting is scheduled for July 26th, 2005 due to
numerous conflicts with the normal date of July 19th.


### Better Business Bureau Report

Ian Jackson tabled his report on SPI's compliance with Better Business
Bureau standards.

There was no disagreement on his recommendations from those who read it.
The recommendations are to be implemented as practical.


## Adjournment

The next meeting is scheduled for July 1st, 2005 at 19:00 UTC.

==============================================

This report uses a cash-based method of accounting,
recording donations when deposited (not when the check was
written or received by us) and recording expenses when sent
or scheduled for payment (not when incurred). Network for
Good processing fees are no longer listed, to avoid confusion
as happened last time, and since they are already subtracted
out from our check before we ever receive it. We now have Q1
2005 data for our AmEx Financial Advisors account (with income
from the AXP Cash Management fund), which is included in
April's report despite it covering a period of three months.
Donations received in April will be in June's report, since
they were deposited then.

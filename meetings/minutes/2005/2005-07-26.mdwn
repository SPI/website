## Resolution 2005-07-26.bp.1: Opensource.org

__Resolution 2005-07-26.bp.1: Open Source Initiative domain transfer __

<pre>
      1. WHEREAS The historical reasons for SPI holding the opensource.org domain no longer apply;
      2. The board resolves that the opensource.org domain be transferred to the Open Source Initiative Inc.
</pre>

Ian Jackson states the reason that he objects to this resolution is that "SPI
is a membership controlled organisation and OSI is a self-perpetuating board.
I don't think a self-perpetuating board is an appropriate structure for this."

David Graham states that this is just where SPI was three years ago.

Branden Robinson states that "I for one am pleased to see that OSI has suddenly
realized that license proliferation is bad thing, after spending so many years
being the single biggest cause of it, but IMO it's not enough."

Jimmy Kaplowitz moves for a vote on the resolution, seconded by David Graham.

Resolution 2005-07-26.bp.1 fails with a vote of: Yes: 2, No: 2, Abstain: 2.

No real progress is reported.

This report uses a cash-based method of accounting,
recording donations when deposited (not when the check was
written or received by us) and recording expenses when sent
or scheduled for payment (not when incurred). Network for
Good processing fees are no longer listed, both to avoid
confusion and since they are already subtracted out from our
check before we ever receive it.

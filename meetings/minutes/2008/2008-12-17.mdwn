## Appendix B: Approved Resolutions

### Resolution 2008-12-17.bg.1 - Privoxy as associated project

<pre>
SPI Resolution 2008-12-17.bg.1

WHEREAS

 1. Privoxy is a significant Free Software project, delivering a non-caching
    HTTP proxy that is commonly used to increase a user's privacy level,
    to block ads, and to rewrite content for other purposes.

 2. The Privoxy developers would like SPI's support and assistance,
    including receiving and holding property (e.g., donations) on behalf
    of the project, dispersing donations to project members, legal
    advice and representation, holding assets such as the privoxy.org domain,
    and possibly other services to be decided later by the Privoxy developers.

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

 3. Privoxy is formally invited to become an SPI Associated Project,
    according to the SPI Framework for Associated Projects, SPI
    Resolution 1998-11-16.iwj.1-amended-2004-08-10.iwj.1, a copy of
    which can be found at
    https://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/resolutions/2004/2004-08-10.iwj.1

 4. Fabian Keil is recognised by SPI as the current authoritative decision
    maker for Privoxy.  This can be changed in the future by consensus vote
    of Hal Burgiss, Fabian Keil, and David Schmidt.

 5. This invitation will lapse, if not accepted, 60 days after it is
    approved by the SPI Board.
</pre>

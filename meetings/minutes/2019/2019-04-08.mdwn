These are the minutes for the April 8th, 2019 SPI Board Meeting,
held at 20:00 UTC in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.
[LOG](../../../logs/2019/2019-04-08-log.txt).

## President's Report

<pre>
During the last month, Martin Michlmayr resigned from the board. We
thank him greatly for his service and wish him well in his future
activities. He continues to work with us as a contractor. We also
started working with Larry Rosenman (ler) as an IT contractor.

Last, I'm working with Debian to figure out AWS and Azure accounts for
cloud image publication, and with Jenkins and Linux Foundation and our
legal counsel to facilitate asset transfers to their new Continuous
Delivery Foundation in a way that meets our legal needs.
</pre>

## Treasurer's report

<pre>
SPI released its 2018 Annual Report and monthly treasurer's reports
for January - March, 2019. Many thanks to Martin Michlmayr for
completing the reports and working on streamlining the treasury
toolset.

We have received a quote from a CPA for auditing SPI's 2018 financials
and filing our 2018 federal and New York State tax forms. The quote is
slightly higher than the original estimate but still within reason - I
can sign the engagement letter this week.
</pre>

## Secretary's report

<pre>
Voting has concluded on the bylaws vote but I'm frustratingly unable
to see the result.
</pre>

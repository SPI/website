## President's Report

<pre>
Since the July meeting I've been tying up loose ends, such as making
sure the status of Larry Rosenman's IT services contract got resolved
(it was extended through end of year) and committing my remaining
uncommitted contract documents to the board-private git
repository. Once again, thank you for the pleasure of serving SPI as
director and as president.
</pre>

## Treasurer's report

<pre>
Thank you to Martin Michlmayr for his continued work on SPI's periodic
treasury reports as well as working with our CPA firm on SPI's
voluntary audit of its 2018 finances. The audit is progressing as
expected and thanks to Martin's work our backlog in reporting is
caught up.
</pre>

## Secretary's report

<pre>
We have a nomination for each officer position for the coming term
which is fantastic to see.  Other than that, nothing to report.
</pre>

## Appendix B: Resolution 2019-08-11.tp.1: Removing Drizzle as an associated project

<pre>
WHEREAS

1. Drizzle is currently an SPI associated project.

2. The Drizzle project, a fork of the MySQL project made in 2008, has
been defunct for many years and is no longer under active development.

3. The Drizzle project liaison has proposed that it should be removed
from the list of active SPI projects.

4. The Drizzle project liaison has proposed that all Drizzle assets are
to be forwarded to the SPI general fund.

5. In particular the Drizzle trademark is free to be managed by the SPI
board as best fits the overall mission of SPI.

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

1. Drizzle is removed from the list of SPI associated projects.

2. SPI will no longer actively seek donations on behalf of Drizzle.

3. This is subject to any undischarged obligations SPI may have with
respect to Drizzle. We are not aware of any such undischarged
obligations. We ask anyone who is aware of any to notify us within 30
days of this resolution.

4. It is SPI's good-faith intention to manage the Drizzle
trademark in a manner that appropriately befits the overall mission
of SPI.

### IT plan

Luca Filipozzi briefly expressed the need for a clear direction on
whether to pursue 'serverless' (ie, find service providers for
everything we do) or 'server' meaning we'll get a few EC2 instances
with hopefully an almost unanimous agreement by the board. As we have
cash available Luca mentioned that our IT plan shouldn't be about cost
but rather whether we should outsource (effectively).

It was agreed to start and continue the discussion over the board
mailing list.

## Any other business

### Face-to-face meeting

It was agreed to give Valerie Young some more time to express a
preference for a date for the face-to-face meeting, currently a tie

It was agreed that Stephen Frost will attempt to automate the bylaw
vote request emails by mid-September.

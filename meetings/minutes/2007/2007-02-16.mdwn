## President's Report

<pre>
Nothing significant to report this month.
</pre>


## Treasurer's Report

<pre>
Account Balances
-------------------
As of 2007-01-31
FirstIB Checking: $93,361.78
Key Bank Checking: $30,058.20
Ameriprise Financial (2006-12-31): $12,372.69

Banking Status
-------------------
We have opened an account at Key Bank, which hopefully will suit our needs
better than FirstIB did.  After 90 days, if we are happy with Key Bank and
have cleared all checks from FirstIB, we will close the FirstIB account.

We should consider transferring the bulk of the Debian funds to the
investment account so they will earn interest if not being spent.

We have also opened an account with XETrade.   This will allow us to do
foreign-current wire transfers for between $10 and $25 and much faster
than via our bank.  XETrade services should be available by 2/16.

Data Entry Status
---------------------
After several OSS options failed for bulk data entry, with the help of a
consultant we constructed an ad-hoc data entry interface for donations and
expenses in PHP+PostgreSQL on one of my development servers.  Current
status of data entry backlog is:
2006 Donations: 100% entered, 70% deposit dated, 30% checked, 0% reconciled
2007 Donations: 0% entered
2006 Expenses: 95% entered, 30% checked, 0% reconciled
2007 Expenses: entered to 2007-01-31

Income Report by received date and organization

January draft income report:
   project   | expenses |  income  |   net
-------------+----------+----------+----------
 Debian      |          | 11129.97 | 11129.97
 Gallery     |          |   242.88 |   242.88
 OVF         |   374.18 |   111.44 |  -262.74
 PostgreSQL  |   475.00 |  1121.21 |   646.21
 SPI 5%      |     0.00 |   571.44 |   571.44
 SPI General |    55.52 |  1985.48 |  1929.96

However, this income report rests on an important question of how we book
money for fundraising purposes.

Each donation has up to four dates associated with it: the date it is
donated (check date or book date for credit cards), the date it is sent to
us, the date it is received and the date it is deposited in an SPI bank
account.

We have no current guidelines on when we should book income for fundraising
purposes, that is, when it should be available for the projects to use.
While book date for the IRS is deposit date, I'm reluctant to use that for
the income date because our deposits for some kind of income (such as
credit cards) can be as much as 6 weeks after the donor makes the gift.  I
don't want to tell a project they can't write checks if I know they have
$4000 on the way.

The above income statement ... and the one for 2006 ... were based on the
somewhat complex calculation of mailbox receipt date for checks and cc book
date for credit cards.   I don't know if this is misleading and if I
should be doing it this way.


Outstanding issues:
Still need detail on $29,000 sent to Mexico for DebConf6 and one $500
travel compensation, plus about $3000 in donations whose designation is
being reviewed.
There are some discrepancies between our and FirstIB's accounts totalling
about $900 which we are still resolving.

Once data entry is completed, I'll be discussing with financial officers
whether or not to move to LedgerSMB1.2 or to wait for 1.3 which will have
resolved a number of issues which make it currently cumbersome for us to
use.

Other Notes
---------------
The treasurer again points out that SPI, particularly Debian, is
accumulating large amounts of cash.   This is not what 501(c)3s are
supposed to do; we should come up with some plans for spending it or put
it into an endowment.

Maybe it's time for a legal defense fund, or the E&amp;O insurance we talked
about?  Or can I at least fund major work in accounting software?

I will be working with the CPA, schultmc and other relevant parties about how
to get this into a proper accounting system for our 2006 taxes and beyond.

## Secretary's Report

<pre>
I've received one mail to secretary@spi-inc.org, which was carbon-copied to
spi-general. All other communication has been resolutions on public SPI mailing
lists.

## Spanish Trademark Report

<pre>
The current PoA form is progressing a little slower than I first envisioned,
which is due to myself misplacing a email from Greg asking some questions about
the form. This has now been forwarded to Javier for clarification, and I hope
to have affirmative action to report by next board meeting.

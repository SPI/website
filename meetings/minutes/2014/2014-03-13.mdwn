</pre>

Michael was not present but had sent out the November 2013 report in
advance of the meeting. There was a query from drycafe about seeing a
breakdown of wire transfers to a project and Bdale he should file an RT
ticket. Jimmy also mentioned the fact that we have a backlog of
treasurer reports.


## Secretary's report

Jonathan was not present.


## Outstanding minutes

As Jonathan was not present it was decided to postpone voting on the
outstanding meeting minutes until April.


## Items up for discussion

### Status of SPI's support infrastructure for associated project services

Hilmar Lapp of OBF asked for this item to be included on the agenda due
to delays in handling various DNS related requests. The domains had been
transferred to SPI but not yet configured for DNS hosting by SPI. Joerg
indicated the SPI sysadmin team consisted of just him and Michael and
that this was not enough as they were both generally busy. There had
been at least one offer of help on the SPI lists that Joerg was going to
pursue, and he said we could expect an update by the next meeting.


## Any other business

No one had any other items to discuss.


## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Thursday, April 10th, 2014 at 20:00
UTC in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.

[LOG](../../../logs/2014/2014-09-11-log.txt).


## President's Report

Bdale Garbee was not present, so there is no report from the President.


## Treasurer's report

Michael Schultheiss was not present, so there is no report from the
Treasurer.


## Secretary's report

Martin Michlmayr stated that the web site and by-laws had been updated to
reflect the current directors and officers.  Martin Zobel-Helas kindly
prepared minutes for the August meeting.  Martin Michlmayr found a minor
inaccuracy in the July minutes which he proposed to fix without
re-approval from the board; there were no objections.

## Any other business

Jonathan McDowell mentioned that he had fixed the members website back at
the start of August such that the repository in version control matches the
code running on the server.

Robert Brockway asked whether he could proceed with the suggestion he made
on the SPI mailing list a few weeks ago that SPI join the Nonprofit
Coordinating Committee of New York (NPCC).  According to Brockway, they
would be a useful source of information on running a 501(c)(3) non-profit
organization in the state of New York and they offer affordable options for
D&amp;O insurance.  Jonathan McDowell would like a better understanding of
the annual dues that we would be committing to, and Joerg Jaspert said that
we needed a resolution to vote on.

Martin Zobel-Helas noted that one project, Sonar GNU/Linux, has requested
to join SPI but there are some open questions regarding the structure of
the project.  We are currently waiting to hear from them.


## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Thursday, October 9th, 2014 at 20:00 UTC
in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.

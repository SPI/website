Michael reported that he was still working on the backlog and working
with the bookkeeper. The egative balance for ankur.or.in is due to cash
accounting method (awaiting funds from Google Summer of Code - posted in
December 2013).


## Secretary's report

Jonathan had nothing to report.


## Outstanding minutes

Vote on Meeting Minutes for 12th December 2013 board meeting:

<table><tbody>
<tr><td>Clint Adams</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Robert Brockway</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bdale Garbee</td><td>Abstain</td></tr>
<tr><td>Jonathan McDowell</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Michael Schultheiss</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Martin Zobel-Helas</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

Motion passed with a vote of 5 yes, 1 abstain, 0 missing.


## Any other business

Martin asked where DNS update requests for SPI held domains should go;
Michael responded with admin@rt.spi-inc.org. Josh Berkus raised the
issue that we'd been seeing more fraudulent transactions through
Click&Pledge and that we should be looking for an alternative provider.
There was also some discussion about the process of opening a new
account to handle Paypal donations, as voted on last month. The main
issue is finding a suitable bank who we can jump through the appropriate
hoops for given the geographical spread of board/required signatories.

## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Thursday, February 13th, 2014 at 20:00 UTC
in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.

Jonathan stated that there were 3 seats up for election this year and
nominations were open until the close of July 13th. 2 nominations had
already been received. Elections were due to open on July 15th if a
sufficient number of nominations were received.

Joshua suggested that SPI should look at Hangouts on Air (Google public
video conferencing) as a way of getting some more exposure to the wider
community. There was some push back about using a non-free system to
enable this, and some general queries about whether video conferencing
was something that would improve engagement. Several board members
indicated they'd have had difficulty attending board meetings in the
past if video (or even just audio) conferencing was in use. Edward
chipped in to indicate that their could be some benefit in getting the
SPI web site better setup with analytics, and getting associated
projects to link back to us.

Joerg mentioned that we'd have a graphic designer contact us to do some
work, who might be able to help improve the website in general.

## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Thursday, August 14th, 2014 at 20:00 UTC
in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.

The backlog of reports was raised and Michael stated he was working on
them and hoped to be done by the next meeting. He also said he'd check
with the contract book-keepers to see what the status of reports from
them was.

## Secretary's report

Jonathan indicated he was slowly trying to get the remaining items (old
votes + agendas) moved over from the pre-ikiwiki website.

## Items up for discussion

There was an outstanding new project request from Chakra but as there
was still discussion about the correct wording for new project
resolutions it was not added to the agenda.

Bdale reported that there was a desire from Debian folk to have
somewhere to assign copyrights in order to assist with GPL enforcement
actions. He had been asked if there was any objection to SFC providing
this service to Debian. None of the board had any objections. Bradley
Kuhn was present and noted that there would be no problem with SPI
taking over this role in the future should that be desired.

Jimmy reminded the board that he had tendered his resignation and would
be stepping down after the next board meeting. He urged the board to
select an interim board member via an email vote soon. Jonathan stated
he had been hoping to draw up a draft role specification but had not
found the time to do so.

Jimmy also mentioned that New York (where SPI is incorporated) had
overhauled its Not-for-Profit corporation law. The board should
investigate and see what, if any, changes are required.

Joerg stated that some volunteers had contact him and Michael about
helping out with the SPI sysadmin tasks.

## Any other business

Robert indicated a dislike of 2009-11-04.jmd.1 (Contributing member

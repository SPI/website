## President's Report

<pre>
Continued thanks to SPI Vice President, Stephen Frost, for handling
contracting with SPI's contractors. Stephen continues to do a
fantastic job working with our contractors and legal counsel.

I sent tpot certified documents requested by UK counsel per an associated
project's request
</pre>

## Treasurer's report

Report presented by Michael Schultheiss on behalf of Martin Zobel-Helas.

<pre>
The SPI treasury team is continuing to process requests and is
striving for more timely ticket handling. The backlog is being
processed but if there are any board members who would like to assist
with treasury tasks, additional help is always welcome.
</pre>

## Secretary's report

<pre>
I've also sent off some requested information to UK counsel and
hopefully our engagement should start soon.

Please respond to the vF2F poll for May (see email). I've scheduled a
bunch of times across a bunch of days so hopefully we should be able
to have some overlap where everyone can join.
</pre>

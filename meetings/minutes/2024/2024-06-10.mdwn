A lot of effort to finalize auditor requested data, so they can proceed with audit for 2023.

Coordinated with sysadmin on transferring several Debian domains to SPI,
released monthly reports, coordinated with associated projects about best
practices to process payments for events, then there are pending payments

Thanks to all members supporting treasurer activities.

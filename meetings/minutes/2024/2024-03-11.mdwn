## President's report

<pre>
I am working with our broker at Merrill Lynch to establish the recommended

that paperwork signed and submitted shortly.

Thank you to SPI Director Jonatas L. Nogueira for helping track outstanding tasks.

Continued thanks to SPI Vice President, Stephen Frost, for handling contracting
with SPI's contractors. Stephen continues to do a fantastic job working with our
contractors and legal counsel.

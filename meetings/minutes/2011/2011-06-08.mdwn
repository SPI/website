at 20:30 UTC in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.
[LOG](../../../logs/2011/2011-06-08-log.txt).


## President's Report

Bdale thanked Joshua Drake and his company Command Prompt for their continuing
support of SPI. The SPI admin team recently moved a webapp used by our
treasurer from a physical server installed on 28 October 2006 to a virtual
machine. It is only through the ongoing generosity of Command Prompt and our
other resource donors that SPI is able to provide services to our associated
projects.


## Treasurer's report

<pre>
This report uses a cash-based method of accounting, recording donations
when deposited (not when the check was written or received by us) and
recording expenses when sent or scheduled for payment (not when
incurred).

### 2011-05-12.jmd.1: ankur.org.in as an associated project

Vote on 2011-05-12.jmd.1: ankur.org.in as an associated project

There was some discussion about whether a US organisation was the best choice
for an Indian project, but Sankarshan stated they had exhausted the options for
a suitable local structure/body.

</tbody></table>

Motion passed with a vote of 7 yes, 0 missing.

Sankarshan accepted on behalf of ankur.org.in during the meeting.

## Any other business

Mention was made of the fact that nothing had been heard from Jenkins since we
informed them they'd been accepted as an associated project. [They've since
been in touch and accepted.]

It was pointed out that the annual board election was coming up and the
spi-projects list had been emailed to reminded associated projects that they
might want to get involved.

The status of the Debian European trademark was asked about; our contact at the
SFLC had been on vacation but was expected back shortly.

Joshua mentioned that PgWest was at the end of September (in San Jose) and that
he thought it might be interesting to have some sort of SPI day as part of it.

Finally it was pointed out that we'd failed to produce an annual report for a
while and that we should try harder to achieve something this year.

## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Wednesday, July 13th, 2011 at 20:30
UTC in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.

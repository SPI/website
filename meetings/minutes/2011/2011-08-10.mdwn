There was some discussion about getting close to the $250k assets level and
whether this would mean we'd need a formal CPA audit under NY/IRS rules.
Michael reported that we were currently exempt from this requirement and that
it was related to how much was collected from NY sources.


## Secretary's report

Nothing much to report; Tux4Kids had been missing from our projects list, but
this has been corrected. There was some discussion about keeping an up-to-date
list of contact details for our project representatives, and whether it was
acceptable to do so on the project pages. It was agreed the representatives
should contacted about whether it was ok to list their email addresses
publicly.

## Any other business

Henrik Ingo from Drizzle was present at the meeting and accepted the associated
project status offer on behalf of the project.

There was some query about which email address our SFLC representative should
have subscribed to our board list; a generic role address or a specific
individual. It was agreed that for legal representatives a specific address
made more sense.

Jimmy reported that we'd heard back from Mishi at SFLC confirming that WIPO had
given us a certification of registration of the Debian trademark under the
Madrid Protocol, covering the EU, China, Japan and the UK.


## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Wednesday, September 14th, 2011 at 20:30

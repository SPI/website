## President's Report

None.

## Treasurer's Report

Michael Schultheiss provided the following revised financial reports for
December 2010, as well as the reports for January 2011:

<pre>
At the 2011-01-12 SPI board meeting, there was a query around the higher
than normal credit card processing fees attributed to SPI's general
expenses during this reporting period.  I contacted the credit card
processing firm and learned that $685.00 of these fees were for a
chargeback against a DebConf professional attendee fee that the attendee
had accidentally paid twice.  This chargeback has been listed as a
Debian expense in this updated report.  I also fixed an arithmetic error
with The HeliOS Project and YafaRay balances.


This report uses a cash-based method of accounting, recording donations
when deposited (not when the check was written or received by us) and
recording expenses when sent or scheduled for payment (not when
incurred).

[LOG](../../../logs/2011/2011-04-13-log.txt).


## President's Report

Bdale reported that he'd spent some time recently working with a new
representative of the Open64 community, resulting in the resolution
voted on at this meeting.

He was also recently interviewed by the US Department of Justice
anti-trust folks on behalf of Debian. The contents of the interview are
confidential, but he was encouraged by the way they reached out to the
Free Software world for input on a pending matter in this way.

## Secretary's report

Jonathan indicated that he was pleased that the LibreOffice associated
project resolution had been able to be dealt with via a unanimous email
vote, rather than being delayed until this month after last month's
failure to make quorum.

## Items up for discussion

### 2011-04-13.bg.1: Open64 as associated project

There was some discussion about objections raised by Chris Bergström in
regards to Open64's association. Everyone had read them, but felt that
there were no major concerns to their addition under the SPI umbrella.

## Any other business

There was some discussion about the board election that is coming up in
July. Jonathan suggested that rather than just 2 positions for the
expiring seats we increase the number to 3, to cover the seat lost last
year. There was general agreement about this.

Martin asked if anything had further had been heard from the Jenkins
project, who had been in touch about potentially becoming an associated
project. Nothing had been, so he said he'd get in touch with them to
find out the current status.


## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Wednesday, May 11th, 2011 at 20:30
UTC in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.

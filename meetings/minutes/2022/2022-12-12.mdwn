## President's Report

<pre>
Our 2021 audit has been completed. Our Federal tax filing has been submitted
and we are finalizing the submission of our New York State filing.  Continued
thanks to SPI Vice President, Stephen Frost, for handling contracting with
SPI's contractors. Stephen continues to do a fantastic job working with our
contractors and legal counsel.
</pre>

Vice-president's report:

Provided by Perdu, after meeting (not reflected in logs):
<pre>
Since Snow-Man wasn't able to mention IT-related stuff, I wanted to add
something, as I think nobody saw my RT ticket: I switched off the chic server
(chic.spi-inc.org and chic2.spi-inc.org), which is supposedly a defunct server
with no service running. If someone sees a missing service, please shout as I
will completely remove this server at end of the month so that RapidSwitch
stops.
</pre>

## Treasurer's report

<pre>
Payments are being processed. Collected statements from past months and monthly
reports should go out so on. Since this is last month of the year, we should
close books, we'd appreciate if you have some request for this year to do it
sooner than later.
</pre>

## Secretary's report

<pre>
Battle for Wesnoth still requires the Apple account holder to accept the
transfer. We mistakenly believed that account ownership had been transferred to
the President, but further investigation revealed that the previous secretary's
personal account is still in use. I am contacting him to resolve this issue.

I received no recommendations from SPI membership for the membership committee.
Therefore, our vote today will be to include officers and jesusalva as the
membership committee, unless a board member wishes to add or remove themselves
from that list.
</pre>

### Change of mailing address

The Treasury team was notified by our mailbox provider that their third party
partner lost the lease to our current mailing list location. They were able to
obtain a new location down the street but it is also possible it may be lost at
some point in the future since it's not owned by the mailbox provider.

They do own their main facility in Sanford, North Carolina and suggest for the
best service (faster turnaround and no potential future lost lease) we migrate
to that address.

Vote to move to the Sanford, NC, USA address:

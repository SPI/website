## President's Report

Bdale Garbee had nothing to report.


## Treasurer's report

Following the face-to-face meeting in New York in February, Michael
Schultheiss has been working on transitioning SPI to ledger-cli and hoped
to have the this month's report available within the next few days using
ledger-cli.

Michael thanked the Craigslist Foundation for donating $25,000 each
again to SPI's general fund and to PostgreSQL.


## Secretary's report

Martin Michlmayr has completed the February minutes, including a summary
of the face-to-face meeting in New York.

The board adopted a Conflict of Interest policy in the February meeting.
Everyone who attended the face-to-face meeting in New York has completed
their conflict of interest declaration.  Unfortunately, despite several
reminders, some declarations from the other directors are still
outstanding.

At the face-to-face meeting in New York, the board agreed to do a member
ping.  Martin thanked Jonathan McDowell for starting this ping in the
meantime.

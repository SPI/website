## President's Report

President's Report, as added to agenda:

2016 was a productive year for SPI.  We held a face-to-face meeting in
New York where we discussed outstanding items as well as the roadmap
for the organization.

We've made good progress during 2016 to move to an accounting system
based on ledger-cli.

We've seen a lot of interest in SPI and we accepted several projects
as SPI associated projects.  See the [2016 Annual Report](/corporate/annual-reports/2016.pdf)
for updates from new and existing associated projects.

I'd like to thank everyone who contributed to SPI and the FOSS
community!


## Treasurer's report

The treasurer's report, covering the period from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, can be viewed in Appendix B.

In summary, SPI has received donations of USD 427,744.01 and had expenses of USD 203,832.04 for a net income of USD 224,254.72. SPI's assets as of December 31, 2016 are USD 1,060,871.56. This is the first year SPI has held over $1M in assets.

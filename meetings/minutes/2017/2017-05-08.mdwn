## President's Report

President's report, as added to the agenda:

I signed some contracts related to DebConf over the last months.  Thanks
to the DebConf organizers for working with the venue and other companies.
We also have a quote for D&O liability insurance which we have to review.
I've been away due to personal reasons but should have more time from
now on.

## Treasurer's report

Michael Schultheiss, Dimitri John Ledkov and Martin Zobel-Helas are working to import 2017 data into ledger. Schultheiss requested an automatic 6 month extension to our 2016 federal tax filing and the request was granted; the 990 federal tax fillings are due on November 15th, 2017. It is a goal of the board to hire an outside accountant to the tax filings and audits before November 2017. If the board does not meet our goal, Schultheiss has the expertise to do the filings in-house. Schultheiss also reports the new New York City mail service works well and he will set up forwarding from the Indianapolis PO box to the NYC address this month.

## Secretary's report

Valerie Young attended the The Document Foundation (TDF) advisory board meeting on April 20th, 2017. TDF is doing well and had no questions for SPI.

## Items up for discussion

### Review progress of reimbursement streamlining

Luca Filipozzi has outlined a reimbursement streamlining plan based on the February F2F discussion: 
https://pad.riseup.net/p/reimbursement-tech-plan

Filipozzi would like the board to provide guidance on the Data and Technology sections, and for board members to volunteer to take action items by adding their initials. Filipozzi acknowledges he incorporated Micheal Schultheiss's feedback with regard to reimbursing applicants in their home currency; last meeting he proposed reimbursing applicants only in USD to ease SPI's work but Schultheiss explained such a policy would not eliminate work. Instead, the plan includes a mandate for "one reimbursement request per currency".

Filipozzi is also in contact with the DebConf2017 organizers to comunicate and field feedback on any future changes to the reimbursement process. Additionally Filipozzi has found a colleague at UBC ECE who expressed interested in doing part time work to process reimbursements for SPI. Filipozzi will be meeting with her to discuss the work in more detail this week.

Finally Filipozzi request a permission from the board to move forward with the plan as outline. All board members present consent. Absent board members are request to reply within 48hr of the meeting with any other concerns.

### External advice for 2017 financial audit

Martin Michlmayr states he has not been able to move forward with this item but will report back next board meeting. If any board member would like to pick up this task, please contact Michlmayr.

### Review of F2F action items

Luca Filipozzi: Along with the work on the reimbursement streamlining, Filipozzi has become documenting SPI board members roles and responsibilities. He will need assistance filling in the assets. See documentation in progress here: 
https://pad.riseup.net/p/SPI_Roles_and_Responsibilities

Dimitri John Ledkov: Ledkov, Schultheiss and Zobel have closed the 2016 account but not prepared the relevant filings.

Martin Michlmayr: Michlmayr has sent legal questions to Misha and documented banking procedures. 

Jimmy Kaplowitz: Kaplowitz has not heard back from Mishi and will follow up with her this soon with regard to the new bylaws.

Michael Schultheiss: Schultheiss will set up mail forwarding this month.

Valerie Young: Young will send an email about SPI membership with request for feedback soon.

## Any other business

### DebConf2017

Dimitri Ledkov reports DebConf organizers have asked whether SPI could support the use of an online payment in the DebConf portal, either through PayPal or Stripe, to accept payments from attendees. The board agree it is possible. Additionally it is possible to get a PayPal card readers gratis from PayPal to accept payments on the ground. Martin Michlmayr asks if a board member could respond to the organizers with this answer.

### Use of 5-year CD for SPI funds

Dimitri Ledkov asks for a status update on the ongoing discussion of whether or not to use a 5 year CD for 250k of SPI's assets. The fee for withdrawing money early will be the cost of the first year of interests. SPI presently is getting 0% interest on it's monetary assets. Michael Schultheiss states he will follow up in email.

## Adjournment

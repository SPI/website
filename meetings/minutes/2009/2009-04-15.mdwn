Michael agreed to email the spi-projects mailing list to remind projects to
spend rather than hoard funds.


## Secretary's Report

Jimmy Kaplowitz provided the following secretary's report.

> I notified Gregers Petersen and the openwrt-hackers email list of SPI's
> invitation to become an SPI associated project with Gregers as sole
> liaison, and mentioned the 60-day deadline of May 17, 2009. I checked
> with them on April 14th, and Gregers replied on the 15th accepting the
> offer with himself serving "as main liaison, and Andy Boyett as
> second/back-up liaison." Unless the Board deems the existence of a
> second/back-up liaison to be at odds with the resolution passed in
> March, this makes OpenWRT's associated project status official.

After brief discussion, the Board considered OpenWRT's response to be
acceptable, thus finalizing OpenWRT's status as an SPI associated
project.

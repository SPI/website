</pre>

Michael stated that the reason for the atypically low amount of income is
because most of April's donations were deposited on May 1st. He also noted that
the 2008 IRS Form 990 (an information-reporting return to federal tax
authorities) has not yet been filed, but that the accountants automatically
file extensions for SPI and that this extension filing actually occurred.


## Secretary's Report

Jimmy Kaplowitz provided the following secretary's report.

> As a reminder, next year's annual Debian Conference, DebConf10, will be
> in the US for the first time (specifically NYC), and so SPI will be
> serving as the local legal entity. I am the lead of the DebConf10 local
> team. In my role as SPI Secretary, I provided a visa invitation letter
> to a Debian participant who wishes to attend and who will need a visa.
> This letter was drafted in consultation with me by a lawyer, Frank
> Bynum, with knowledge of visa, immigration, and border law who has
> agreed to help DebConf10 with these issues.
> 
> Substantially the same letter, as modified for each visa applicant's
> individual circumstances, is expected to be used for the rest of the
> DebConf10 visa invitation letters, without further mention in SPI
> secretary's reports unless specific circumstances warrant it. I can
> provide the letter template to the board and others upon request, but
> DebConf does not wish to make it public to reduce the risk of abuse by
> those wishing to involve DebConf in illegal immigration attempts. (This
> happens every year, not just for the US-based conference.)

Some discussion about DebConf10 itself ensued, but there was no further
discussion on the secretary's report or on any other aspect of SPI's
relationship with DebConf10.


##Outstanding Minutes

Jimmy Kaplowitz again presented the March 2009 minutes, identical to
those approved in April except for the correction of a typo in Julien
Cristau's name.  These corrected minutes were accepted by unanimous
consent without an explicit vote. Jimmy then presented the April 2009
minutes for approval.

## Other Business

David Graham noted that the June meeting is the last before SPI's 2009
elections. It was agreed that Jimmy, in his role as Secretary, would
work with the membership committee to ensure the list of members is up
to date and that the contributing members know how many seats are up for
election, so they can prepare to run.

## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Wednesday, June 17th, 2009 at 20:00 UTC
in #spi on irc.oftc.net.

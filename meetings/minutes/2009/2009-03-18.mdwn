Some discussion ensued regarding the growth in funds held by SPI. Michael
encouraged SPI associated projects to use funds that have been donated for
their intended purpose rather than building up reserves. Bdale emphasized that
only about $32,000 of funds held by SPI are on its own behalf and not in trust
for associated projects. Contributing member Joe Nahmias asked about reducing
the 5% fee which SPI levies on incoming donations since SPI already has a
sizable reserve; it was agreed to discuss this via email. Several board members
congratulated Michael once again on having regular reports each months.


## Secretary's Report

Jimmy Kaplowitz provided the following secretary's report.

* Within 40 minutes of the conclusion of the February 11 board
meeting, the Board and I received an email from Ken Starks of HeliOS
accepting SPI's offer of associated project status for HeliOS, thus
making it official.

* Also, I finally made the promised typo fix to the May 2008 minutes (removing a duplicated occurrence of the word "announced").

* Lastly,
the information in Appendix A has been changed slightly, showing the
date of last election to the board instead of the date of first
election, and reducing the granularity of the displayed date to the
month level. This is more useful for planning future election cycles
and had been requested for some time by David Graham. Thanks to him for
the idea.

### Resolution 2009-03-18.jrk.1: OpenWRT as associated project

Jimmy Kaplowitz presented a resolution to admit OpenWRT as associated project,
originally numbered 2009-03-16.jrk.1.iwj.1. After much discussion, it was
agreed that the board wanted OpenWRT to have a single liaison with SPI instead
of the two they had originally requested, and the board named Gregers Petersen
for that purpose due to his having been SPI's sole contact with OpenWRT up to
this point.

The resolution as finally approved, based on a proposal by Ian Jackson, was
given the number 2009-03-18.jrk.1 and is included in Appendix B of these
minutes. Jimmy agreed to notify Gregers of the invitation.

## Other Business

Joshua D. Drake asked for objections regarding soliciting help from the members
with fixing the membership application on the website. Jimmy requested that the
SPI membership committee and systems administrators be kept in the loop but
otherwise had no objection. Joshua also asked about the status of the new SPI
website; Jimmy replied that nobody had had time to work on it since the last
meeting, and that the status was therefore unchanged since then.

## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Wednesday, April 15th, 2009 at 20:00 UTC
in #spi on irc.oftc.net.

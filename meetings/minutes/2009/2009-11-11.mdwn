Once again the subject of accrual based accounting came up, partly due to the apparent negative balance for the Helios project. It was suggested that rather than the current practice of treating credit card donations only when the cheque is received from the card processor that we should recognise credit card donations at the point they are received by the processor.

## Secretary's Report

Jonathan McDowell provided the following secretary's report:

Zobel apologises; is extremely busy with preparations for the new baby/work.

He will sort out the 2 outstanding sets of minutes. I'll do todays.

We have outstanding requests for associated project status from Sidux
and YafaRay which just need resolutions drafted. I'll do this for the
next meeting.


## Items up for discussion

### Resolution 2009-11-04.jmd.1: Contributing membership expiry


Jonathan McDowell presented this resolution, intended to formally state
the process by which no longer active contributing members will
downgraded to non-contributing status. It was pointed out that this will
only come into action next July/August (ie after the next board
election).

## Appendix B: Approved Resolutions

### SPI Resolution 2009-11-04.jmd.1: Contributing membership expiry

<pre>
WHEREAS

1. Article 3 of the corporate by-laws state: "If a contributing 
   membership is not renewed, the member's status will be downgraded to 
   a non-contributing member.";

2. Voter turnout and quorum is measured as a function of 
   contributing membership;

3. There is no existing practical measure of a member's activity;

4. Elections are the most effective means of verifying a member's 
   activity and our electoral system does not require a voting member 
   to express an opinion on their ballot

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

5. Be it resolved that any contributing member who does not cast a ballot
   in an annual Board member election shall be considered potentially
   inactive. Any contributing member considered potentially inactive shall
   be contacted after the election to confirm their status; if no response
   is received within 4 weeks of this initial contact they shall be deemed
   inactive and downgraded to a non-contributing member. However no such
   downgrading shall preclude any member from restoring their contributing
   membership status at any later date;   

6. In the event that no annual Board member election takes place, 
   regardless of reason, the membership list will not be affected 
   until the next such election takes place;

7. Any contributing membership that exists under any other resolutions
   or clauses that is not subject to expiry will not expire.
</pre>

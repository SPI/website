## President's Report

Bdale Garbee provided the following president's report:

> Last month, I spent two weeks in Spain and Portugal, attending DebConf9
> and DebianDayPT with my daughter Elizabeth.  We had what I think was a
> very successful SPI BOF at DebConf, and it was good seeing the other SPI
> board members who were present there again in person.  Joerg, is there
> video of that BOF available?  If so, perhaps we can point to it.  I
> don't believe any action items worthy of report here came out of that
> BOF, though.  Before our next meeting, my only travel related to Free
> Software will be a brief appearance at the RH Summit in Chicago to speak
> on behalf of HP.  I've also had various emails back and forth with
> representatives of potential associated projects this month, but nothing
> worth reporting here yet.

Jimmy Kaplowitz provided a link to the 
[DebConf9 videos](http://video.debian.net/2009/debconf9) including both
high-quality and low-quality Ogg Theora versions of the SPI BOF.

Michael stated his pleasure at Debian having spent a good portion of its funds,
and encouraged other projects not to hoard funds. He stated he is still
considering a switch to accrual-basis accounting but has not had time to do so
yet. After a few board members expressed their views on this, it was decided
that the topic would be good to discuss via email.

## Secretary's Report

Jimmy Kaplowitz provided the following secretary's report.

> Michael Schultheiss was re-elected and Jonathan McDowell was newly
> elected to the SPI Board of Directors last month. Congratulations to
> them both. Thanks to Greg Sabino Mullane for running. Neil McGovern has
> completed his term on the Board. Thanks to him for his service, and for
> running the 2009 SPI Board elections.
> 
> Due to unforeseen logistical delays, OSUNIX will not be able to have a
> letter from their lawyer at the Software Freedom Law Center in time for
> this meeting which explains the resolution of their licensing issues.
> Therefore, they have agreed to delay revisiting their request to become
> an SPI associated project until the September board meeting.

## Other Business

In response to an inquiry from Joshua D. Drake, Jimmy Kaplowitz informed
the board that the website overhaul was stalled due to a lack of
available man-hours. Joshua agreed to find willing people with
sufficient time. He also asked that the board set goals for the
following year; it was decided that this discussion should occur via
email. David Graham asked for feedback on a proposed resolution of his
and was directed to the mailing lists for that purpose.

## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Wednesday, September 16th, 2009 at 20:00
UTC in #spi on irc.oftc.net. The board tentatively decided that the
default meeting time should thereafter switch to the second Wednesday of
each month. This decision is to be finalized at the September meeting.

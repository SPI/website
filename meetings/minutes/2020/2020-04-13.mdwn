## President's Report

<pre>
Continued thanks to SPI Vice President, Stephen Frost, for handling
contracting with SPI's current and potential contractors. Stephen
continues to do a fantastic job working with our contractors and
legal counsel.

Merrill Lynch has provided the additional paperwork needed to finalize online
access to our account. I'll be reaching out to Stephen Frost and Timothy Potter
to obtain the needed information (Merrill Lynch is requiring US citizens
for the forms as well as the corporate secretary's signature).
</pre>

## Treasurer's report

<pre>
The SPI treasury team is continuing to process requests and is striving for
more timely ticket handling. The backlog is being processed but if there are
any board members who would like to assist with treasury tasks, additional
help is always welcome.
</pre>

## Secretary's report

<pre>
I have caught up with my Secretary TODO list for minutes etc, but no
updates apart from that.
</pre>

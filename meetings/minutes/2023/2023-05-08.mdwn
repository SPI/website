[LOG](../../../logs/2023/2023-05-08.txt).

## President's Report

<pre>
Stephen Frost and I are completing the paperwork for our newest Merrill account,
we will implement the tiered Certificate of Deposit (CD) and investment strategy we discussed
with our financial advisor.

Continued thanks to SPI Vice President, Stephen Frost, for handling contracting 
with SPI's contractors. Stephen continues to do a fantastic job working with our 
contractors and legal counsel.
</pre>

## Vice-president's report:

<pre>
I have a few things I know folks are waiting on and I'm going to be moving those forward shortly.
</pre>

## Treasurer's report

<pre>
There have been some delays processing payments in the past month or so,
however the pending payments queue is very much under control now.

All statements have been collected up to last month, April 2023.
Monthly reports published up to February 2023.

A stripe account has been created, we are currently investigating,
therefore if you find this useful, do not hesitate to reach out.
</pre>

## Secretary's report

<pre>
Because I have been unable to devote sufficient time to secretarial tasks,
I plan to step down as secretary. Zach (zv@) has picked up my slack, and so
I think it appropriate for him to take over the title of secretary until positions
are voted upon in August. This should go into effect for June's meeting.

I plan to maintain my position as a board memter. That said, I haven't received
all conflict-of-interest forms; please send those along if you have not already.

Any necessary formal votes should happen at June's meeting - please let this
serve as ample notice of my plans in this regard :)
</pre>

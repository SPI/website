## President's Report

<pre>
None received
</pre>


## Treasurer's Report

<pre>
Current Status:

LedgerSMB 1.2 has been set up on the new treasurer server.  However, I still
need to set it up for the new chart of accounts (which requires writing some
new stored procedures) and enter some sample transactions so that other
people can help me get caught up for 2006.  Unfortunately, the holidays,
conference travel, and re-organization frenzy at Sun (I have a new boss) have
prevented me from completing this.

Raw figures from the month of November are:

$150 in expenses (PostgreSQL)

No deposits were made in November.  This indicates that there is still an
obstacle to getting deposits made in timely fashion, as we certainly received
donations in November.  I hereby request that the assistant Treasurer make
recommendations on how practically we can get all donations deposited on at
least a bi-weekly (if not a weekly) basis.
</pre>

Concerns were also raised that Branden has not been making bank deposits, so
Josh may be making a proposal to change banks. This is to be discussed later
via email.

## Appendix C: Outstanding Items from the DPL

<pre>
    1) Response to concerns related to the acceptance of Sun Java into
       non-free, see:
           From: John Goerzen
           Date: Wed, 7 Jun 2006 18:28:22 -0500
           Subject: Questions about Java license and related questions
           Message-ID: &lt;20060607232822.GA31686@katherina.lan.complete.org&gt;

    2) Response to concerns related to interaction between Debian developers
       and citizens of embargoed countries, see:
           From: Anthony Towns
           Date: Fri, 9 Jun 2006 17:47:49 +1000
           Subject: Debian in embargoed countries
           Message-ID: &lt;20060609074749.GB1408@azure.humbug.org.au&gt;

    3) Response to concerns related to online harassment, see:
           From: Steve Langasek
           Date: Fri, 9 Jun 2006 17:04:51 -0700
           Subject: request for assistance with ongoing harassment
               [debianwomenpassaway@yahoo.com: Debian women: please pass away.]
           Message-ID: &lt;20060610000450.GN13192@mauritius.dodds.net&gt;

    4) Precise accounting of funds held for the benefit of the Debian
       project (my imprecise estimate is $0, split between -$50,000 for
       debconf, and +$50,000 for misc debian use, which will obviously
       only be useful when the HP money makes its way in)

    5) Is there any sort of online/electronic report of donations from
       Click &amp; Pledge that can be made available?

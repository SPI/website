## President's Report

<pre>
I have little to report today.  I took an action item at our last meeting to
contact Greg Pomerantz, which I have not completed yet.  I hope to catch up
with him later this week.

While it has been a while since SPI used Freenode services on a regular basis,
I note for the record my dismay at learning of the untimely passing of Rob
Levin.
</pre>


## Treasurer's Report

Treasurer reports from January 2006 to April 2006 (inclusive) were submitted,
and were called to be approved by the board:

Motion to accept Jan to April 2006 treasurer reports, moved by David Graham,
seconded by Neil McGovern.

</tbody></table>

Vote passes with: Yes: 7, No: 0, Abstain: 1

Josh has posted account balances for May to August 2006, inclusive. These are
not full financial statements, which need to be constructed.


## Outstanding Minutes

__Current status:__ August 1st, 2006 is ready to be voted on and approved this
meeting. David Graham is processing the previous unapproved minutes, which will
be presented next meeting for approval. Josh plans to get all activity back to
1/1/06 loaded into LedgerSMB.

We hold approximately $80,000 USD in the account, which is mostly Debian funds.
Branden Robinson felt that we should move some of that to the Ameriprise
account, and notes:

<pre>
Our original resolution that authorized change of banks to FirstIB pledged the
Treasurer's effort keep the balance below $5,000
I have two observations on that
1) We've certainly not been doing that
2) That ceiling is probably too low given the magnitude of some transactions
   we're asked to handle
</pre>

Our current bookkeeping service is extremely noncommunicative, partly because
they are cheap. They also do not have a CPA and so do not prepare taxes. Wthin
the next two years, we are looking at having more than a dozen associated
projects and a budget up to $200,000 USD per year.

Josh has talked to three agencies that were recommended to him. Rich and Bander
in NY were extremely responsive, but expensive on first estimate. Josh has been
talking to them about reducing the scope of services to reduce the total cost.

Josh interviewed a second firm in Oregon which is very eager to help us but may
not be able to deal with NY taxes.

The third firm, from NY, has not been very responsive, and has yet to give Josh
an estimate after 3 weeks of phone conversations, so are not going to be
pursued.  Josh asks the board what it would be willing to consider for paying
for a good bookkeeper, which will cost at least $3000 USD.

Josh expects to bring this issue to an email vote before the next meeting.

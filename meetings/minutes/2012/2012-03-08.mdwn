Martin asked if we had any tax related items that needed to be reported
and Michael said that the deadline for our annual report (IRS Form 990)
was May 15th and it was already in progress.


## Secretary's report

Jonathan had nothing to report.


## Outstanding minutes

Vote on Meeting Minutes for 9th February 2012:

<table><tbody>
<tr><td>Clint Adams</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Jonathan McDowell</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Michael Schultheiss </td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Martin Zobel-Helas</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Joerg Jaspert</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Robert Brockway</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

Motion passed with a vote of 6 yes, 0 missing.

## Any other business

Jonathan stated he'd looked at the membership cleanup work (trimming
down the contributing member list to include only those still active),
but that the number of members requiring to be polled was high enough
that doing so via email responses didn't seem reasonable. There was some
discussion about either extending the web interface to allow an "I'm
still interested" indication, or some sort of email processing script.


## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Thursday, April 12th, 2012 at 20:00
UTC in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.

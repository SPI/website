## Secretary's report

Jonathan reported he'd had contact about SPI being part of the Chase
Community Giving program, and it looked like we were eligible. He also

## Any other business

There was further discussion about the status of debian.eu, which is
subject to an abusive registration at present. Michael indicated he'd
sent an initial batch of data to the Debian auditors. Robert queried
informal discussions about extending the board. It was pointed out we
can extend the board to 12 without needing any bylaws amendments, but
that it would make it harder for us to achieve meeting quorum.


## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Thursday, September 13th, 2012 at 20:00
UTC in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.

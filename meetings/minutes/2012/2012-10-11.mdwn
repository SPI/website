There was a query about whether our federal filing was due and Michael
confirmed it had been filed but not yet placed on the website.

some minor cleanups, but appreciated.

Hilmar Lapp from the Open Bioinformatics Foundation was on channel and accepted
SPI's invitation to become an associated project on behalf of the Open
Bioinformatics Foundation.


## Any other business

There was a desire to help lighten the workload of the treasurer. A
suggestion was made that if all requests went through RT then other
board members could help out. Josh Berkus, already acting as assistant
treasurer, indicated he would be prepared to take on more if it was in
RT would he could see it. The topic of a professional bookkeeping
service to help out with routine processing of data was also brought up
again.

This also lead to discussion about the outstanding request from
Debian for some audit related data. It was indicated this should be
completed by the end of October. Bdale stated that no matter what the
underlying reason we should be doing better and should review our
processes to see how we can approve.

Finally the topic of our infrastructure being unreliable was brought up;
both lists and RT have had reliability issues which has not helped with
improving our communication and moving treasurer related tasks into RT.
It was suggested there were already some plans to move things around to
be more reliable.


## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Thursday, November 8th, 2012 at 20:00
UTC in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.

(There was some discussion about this being after the end of summer time
for Europe/the US and so would be an hour earlier for those located there,
but it was decided to leave the time alone for the moment.)

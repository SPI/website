Motion passed with a vote of 6 yes, 2 abstain, 0 missing.

## Items up for discussion

### YafaRay selling training materials

YafaRay had inquired if they could sell training materials under their
SPI associated membership status. The main concern raised was complying
with whatever sales tax laws were applicable, which would depend on
where the materials were sold to. It was suggested the easiest way to
handle this properly might be to outsource it to a third part who would
deal with the entire sales process.

### Discussion of tracking system

This had largely been handled via email, but there was general agreement
that a ticket tracking system was a good idea, the SPI sysadmin team
indicated a preference for RT, no one disagreed and Ganneff said he'd
look at sorting it out before the next meeting.


## Any other business

Jonathan stated there'd been no progress on the membership cleanup,
discussed some of the modifications he believed could be made to the
membership web app to help out; a way of a member being able to indicate
continued interest in SPI that would update a "last active" field in the
DB, modification to the voting scripts to also update this field and a
script to then mail members who had a sufficiently old enough "last
active" field as appropriate with details of where the web app lived if
they were still interested.


## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Thursday, May 17th, 2012 at 20:00
UTC in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.

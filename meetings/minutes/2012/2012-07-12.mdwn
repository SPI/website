## Any other business

There was a discussion about the ongoing Debian audit request for SPI
records related to Debian. There have been delays in this and Robert
suggested getting a CPA to help if it was a proper audit. Martin
Michlmayr (one of the Debian audit team) was suggested as someone who
may be able to help in this case. Some discussion about confidentiality
of other projects occurred and Joerg volunteered to help Michael produce
some data that had non Debian information stripped out.

Martin pointed out nominations for the SPI board election were still
open and we had already received 3 nominations for the 2 available
seats.

Joerg asked Joshua about his recent lack of attendance. Joshua stated
he'd been trying to make the meetings but missing them due to other
events. He's hoping to improve from here on out.

Jonathan mentioned that some limited progress had been made around
sorting out the members.spi-inc.org interface and expiring inactive
members; the source is now in git and had started to be looked at in
terms of the modifications required. Also he reported he'd started the
annual report and asked Bdale and Michael if they could provide their
sections directly to the copy already in spiwww git.


## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Thursday, August 9th, 2012 at 20:00
UTC in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.

There was a query in regards to whether we had hit thresholds related to
reporting rules yet. Michael indicated this was not yet the case, but
that it may become prudent to have audited financial reports.

## Secretary's report

## Items up for discussion

### Discussion of back office support

Robert stated he wished to gauge the feeling of the board members about
moving forward with paid support for certain aspects of SPI's paperwork,
with a view to ensuring we could cope with continued growth. There was
some discussion about what specific tasks assistance would be useful
for. Michael said that book keeping assistance would be helpful and it
was agreed that he and Robert would have an offline discussion about a
firmer proposal.


## Any other business

Robert indicated that David Graham had started a major revision of our
by-laws and expected to be able to present something to the board in the
American spring time frame. It was pointed out that we should do the
inactive membership cull that had been previously discuss, and Jonathan
agreed to come up with a list of people to contact based on the last
board election vote. It was also agreed that all board members would be
added to the membership committee.

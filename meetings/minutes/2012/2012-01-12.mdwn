Motion passed with a vote of 7 yes, 1 abstain, 0 missing.

## Any other business

There was some discussion about making the board mailing list only
contain board members, rather than project liaisons and legal advisors
as it currently does. There was no disagreement to making this happen.
Directors & Officers insurance was brought up again, but no one has yet
found time to get quotes. There is an outstanding transfer of
privoxy.org to SPI that is waiting on the current admin contact to
approve it.


## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Thursday, February 9th, 2012 at 21:00
UTC in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.

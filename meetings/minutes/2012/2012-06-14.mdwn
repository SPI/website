Vote on 2012-05-25.rtb.1: FFmpeg as SPI associated project

wording of the resolution. The general feeling was that if this was a
problem it was with the resolution template rather than specific to
FFmpeg.

## Any other business

The upcoming election was discussed; both Jonathan and Michael's terms
are expiring this year, meaning there are 2 seats available.  Martin has
agreed to run the voting process this year. Joshua's recent lack of
attendance came up, as it has prevented us making quorum on occasion.
Jonathan agreed to contact him to make sure he was receiving meeting
notices ok. No progress has been made on cleaning up the active
membership list. There was an outstanding request from Debian for
financial audit information. Michael was working on it and was going to
provide an initial subset of the information to help them get moving.


## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Thursday, July 12th, 2012 at 20:00
UTC in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.

Michael expressed a wish to publicly thank Google for their generous
donation of $10,000 to the general SPI fund. Jimmy queried how we were
currently accounting for payments fro Click&Pledge and PaySimple.
Michael indicated that we were getting direct deposits from these
payment provides nowadays, and that there was no longer a long delay
due to a need to receive and process a paper check.


## Secretary's report

Jonathan reported that he'd had confirmation we'd be receiving $335.30
from the Chase Giving program at some point.


## Outstanding minutes

Vote on Meeting Minutes for 11th October 2012:

<table><tbody>
<tr><td>Clint Adams</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Robert Brockway</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Jimmy Kaplowitz</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Jonathan McDowell</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Michael Schultheiss </td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Martin Zobel-Helas</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Joerg Jaspert</td><td>Abstain</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

Motion passed with a vote of 6 yes, 1 abstain, 0 missing.


## Any other business

There was further discussion about obtaining the use of a bookkeeping
service to help lighten the workload of the treasurer. It was suggested
a New York based service may make sense as we are incorporated there,
but Michael stated that the amount of NY specific work was minimal. Josh
Berkus offered to contact the bookkeeper that PostgreSQL Experts use and
see if they had the resources to help us out and how much that would
cost.

Robert asked for confirmation that requests to the treasurer for
reimbursement should be sent to the RT alias. It was agreed that this
was the appropriate place.

Some discussion took place about accounting software. Currently Michael
is mainly using spreadsheets. Josh indicated that the lead developer for
LedgerSMB had expressed a willingness to help adapt it to SPI's needs.
Martin suggested the use of Tryton.


## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned until Thursday, December 13th, 2012 at 20:00
UTC in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.

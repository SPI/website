Resolution 2020-06-08.mcs.1: 
2020 Conferences and SPI 5% fee

WHEREAS

1. Software in the Public Interest, Inc. (SPI) is a Debian Trusted
   Organization.

2. The annual Debian Conference (Debian) utilizes SPI to collect
   some of the conference sponsorship funds.

3. SPI has inconsistently charged its 5% administrative fee for
   conference sponsorships.

4. SPI has not yet determined the effect of waiving the 5%
   administrative fee for conference sponsorships in perpetuity.

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

1. For conferences held by SPI associated projects in 2020, SPI
   will waive its 5% administrative fee.

2. Future administrative fee decisions for conference sponsorships will
   be determined at a later date.

## President's report

<pre>
Continued thanks to SPI Vice President, Stephen Frost, for handling
contracting with SPI's current and potential contractors. Stephen
continues to do a fantastic job working with our contractors and
legal counsel.
.
Merrill Lynch's business department has requested physical signatures
rather than the electronic signatures previously submitted. I'm working
with Stephen and Tim to finalize the paperwork this week.
</pre>

## Treasurer's report

<pre>
Michael has reached out to our business development manager at Chase for
assistance with the wire transfers we've had issues with. Michael will
reach out again if he doesn't hear anything early this week.
.
The SPI treasury team is continuing to process requests and is striving for
more timely ticket handling. The backlog is being processed but if there are
any board members who would like to assist with treasury tasks, additional
help is always welcome.

## Secretary's report

Nothing to report.

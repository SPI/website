<pre>
Resolution 2020-06-22.mcs.1:
Conferences and SPI 5% fee

WHEREAS

1. Software in the Public Interest, Inc. (SPI) is a Debian Trusted
   Organization.

2. The annual Debian Conference (Debian) utilizes SPI to collect
   some of the conference sponsorship funds.

3. SPI has inconsistently charged its 5% administrative fee for
   conference sponsorships.

4. SPI has not yet determined the effect of waiving the 5%
   administrative fee for conference sponsorships in perpetuity.

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

1. Going forward, SPI will consistently charge all projects donations
   and conference sponsorships a 5% administrative fee, as is SPI's
   current practice.

2. SPI will not retroactively charge Debian its 5% administrative fee for
   Debian conferences held prior to 2016.

3. SPI will not refund associated projects the 5% administrative fee for
   conferences held 2016-2019.

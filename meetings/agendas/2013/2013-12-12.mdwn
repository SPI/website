## Resolution 2013-12-12.mcs.1: New bank account for PayPal use

<pre>
WHEREAS

 1. Debian and other SPI associated projects have expressed interest in
    accepting donations via PayPal
 2. It is prudent to separate PayPal funds from the general treasury for
    a variety of reasons


THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

 1.  The SPI Treasurer, Assistant Treasurer, Secretary, and President are
     directed to work together as necessary to complete and submit to a
     banking institution of their choosing all application forms necessary
     to open a business banking account relationship with said banking
     institution.
</pre>

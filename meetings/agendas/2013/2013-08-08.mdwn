## Treasurer's report

<pre>
The July 2013 Treasurer's report will be released the week of
2013-08-12.  Apologies for the delay.

I have selected Foster Results of Westfield, IN as SPI's bookkeeping
service.  There is a $350.00 setup fee and a $480.00/mo recurring fee
for their services.  An initial kickoff meeting is in the process of
being scheduled - I plan to have their bookkeeping services in full
service prior to the September 2013 board meeting.

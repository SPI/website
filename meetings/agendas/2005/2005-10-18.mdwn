### Discussion appendix

<pre>
Item 6.4:

Hello,

I don't know if someone else has draw your attention to Debian's web
page license, which is currently non-free Open Publication License.

To change license to something that fits Debian's definition of free,
there is SPI's board's attention needed because SPI has copyright for
Debian's web pages even though no FSF style paperwork has been done.

I'm a bit unsure about how much SPI board cares about Debian
internals, but maybe you want to discuss about this?

This issue has been reported as a bug, please see:

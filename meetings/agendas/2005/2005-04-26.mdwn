# 2005-04-26

This is the proposed agenda for the April 26th, 2005 Board meeting to be held
at 19:00 UTC in #spi on irc.spi-inc.org.

The agenda for this special meeting consists solely of our upcoming tax
filing. The meeting is being called so that we can ensure we are on track
for an on-time, correct, filing, and to do whatever is necessary to make it
happen. Our filing deadline is May 15.

Any other business should be discussed in the mailing lists or wait until
the May meeting, which is tentatively scheduled at its usual date, May 17.

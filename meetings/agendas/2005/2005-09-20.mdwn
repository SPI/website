### Treasurer's Report

Software in the Public Interest Financial Data
==============================================

This report uses a cash-based method of accounting,
recording donations when deposited (not when the check was
written or received by us) and recording expenses when sent
or scheduled for payment (not when incurred). Network for
Good processing fees are no longer listed, both to avoid
confusion and since they are already subtracted out from our
check before we ever receive it.

[1] These numbers appear artificially low because no deposits were made
(aside from a $10 deposit by me) during the months of July and August,
and some or all donations received in June had not been deposited by the
end of August. Branden has now made deposits for June, July, and August
totaling over $3000, but since these were done in early September they
will show up on the next report instead of this one.

[2] According to our online banking information, $2,813.80 of the DebConf5
reimbursements paid so far was withdrawn from our account in July and $5,927.90
of this was withdrawn in August. All of these reimbursements were distributed
as US checks during DebConf5 (quite an improvement from past years!), and so
are listed in the July report in accordance with the paragraph at the top of
this message.

[3] I'd expect that in July or August we received another quarterly statement
for this account reporting a net increase in value, but since Branden hasn't
provided any information about this, and since we don't have online access set
up for that account, I can't include it in this report. I've been nagging him
about several other SPI-related tasks, but I haven't remembered to nag him
about this.

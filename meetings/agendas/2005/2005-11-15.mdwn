### Treasurer's Report

<pre>
Adjusted Treasurer's Report for July 2005

Software in the Public Interest Financial Data (Adjusted)
=========================================================

This report has been adjusted in mid-November 2005 to take
into account the Q2 2005 performance of the AmEx Financial
Advisors account, which was made available to me by Branden
only in late October 2005. No other substantive changes have
been made. The entire quarter corresponding to the Q2 2005
statement is reflected in this report, despite it covering a
period of three months, as was done in the April 2005
report.

This report uses a cash-based method of accounting,
recording donations when deposited (not when the check was
written or received by us) and recording expenses when sent
or scheduled for payment (not when incurred). Network for
Good processing fees are no longer listed, both to avoid
confusion and since they are already subtracted out from our
check before we ever receive it. The specifics of the income
and expenses summarized here will be detailed in one or more
separate "BANK:" mails or snail mail reports.

[1] This is current as of July 13, the closing date of our most recent AmEx
statement, and covers the period from April 14 through then.

[2] According to our online banking information, $2,813.80 of this was
withdrawn from our account in July and $5,927.90 of this was withdrawn in
August. All of these reimbursements were distributed as US checks during
DebConf5 (quite an improvement from past years!), and so are listed in the
July report in accordance with the paragraph at the top of this message.




Adjusted Treasurer's Report for August 2005

Software in the Public Interest Financial Data (Adjusted)
=========================================================

This report has been adjusted in mid-November 2005 to take
into account the Q2 2005 performance of the AmEx Financial
Advisors account, which was made available to me by Branden
only in late October 2005. That income was reported in the
adjusted July 2005 report, and therefore the only
substantive changes here are to the size of assets in the
AmEx account and to the total size of assets.

This report uses a cash-based method of accounting,
recording donations when deposited (not when the check was
written or received by us) and recording expenses when sent
or scheduled for payment (not when incurred). Network for
Good processing fees are no longer listed, both to avoid
confusion and since they are already subtracted out from our
check before we ever receive it.

[1] These numbers appear artificially low because no deposits were made
(aside from a $10 deposit by me) during the months of July and August,
and some or all donations received in June had not been deposited by the
end of August. Branden has now made deposits for June, July, and August
totaling over $3000, but since these were done in early September they
will show up on the next report instead of this one.

[2] According to our online banking information, $2,813.80 of the DebConf5
reimbursements paid so far was withdrawn from our account in July and $5,927.90
of this was withdrawn in August. All of these reimbursements were distributed
as US checks during DebConf5 (quite an improvement from past years!), and so
are listed in the July report in accordance with the paragraph second from the
top of this message.

recording donations when deposited (not when the check was

Good processing fees are no longer listed, both to avoid

[1] Ameriprise Financial used to be American Express Financial Advisors. The
RVS Cash Management Fund used to be the AXP Cash Management Fund. Aren't
corporate spin-offs fun?

[2] This is current as of October 13, the closing date of our most recent
Ameriprise statement, and covers the period from July 14 through then.

[3] Again, keep in mind that the lack of donations listed only means we did
not deposit any donations in October, not that we received none. Reread the
first paragraph of this report if this is unclear.

### Discussion appendix

<pre>
Item 6.4:

Hello,

I don't know if someone else has draw your attention to Debian's web
page license, which is currently non-free Open Publication License.

To change license to something that fits Debian's definition of free,
there is SPI's board's attention needed because SPI has copyright for
Debian's web pages even though no FSF style paperwork has been done.

I'm a bit unsure about how much SPI board cares about Debian
internals, but maybe you want to discuss about this?

This issue has been reported as a bug, please see:

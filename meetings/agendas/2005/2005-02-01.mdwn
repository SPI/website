### Treasurer's Report

<pre>
February 2004 Treasurer's Report

Software in the Public Interest Financial Data
==============================================

This report uses a cash-based method of accounting,
recording donations when deposited (not when the check was
written or received by us) and recording expenses when paid
(not when incurred). Network for Good processing fees are
listed as negative income; the expense category does not
include those because they are subtracted from donations
before we receive them.

Lines marked with a * need to be adjusted to take into
account the January dividend payment into the American
Express Financial Advisors Cash Management account
(abbreviated AmEx Cash Mgmt Acct above), for which no
statement has yet been issued. We are working on
setting up online access to the account, which will
eliminate this difficulty for months after it is set up.

Instead of delaying this report further, the missing
dividend income from January will be included in the report
for February 2005 and will be noted as having occurred in
January.

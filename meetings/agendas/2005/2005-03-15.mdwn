### Treasurer's Report

<pre>
March 2004 Treasurer's Report

Software in the Public Interest Financial Data
==============================================

This report uses a cash-based method of accounting,
recording donations when deposited (not when the check was
written or received by us) and recording expenses when paid
(not when incurred). Network for Good processing fees are
listed as negative income; the expense category does not
include those because they are subtracted from donations
before we receive them. In the balance sheet, those
processing fees are treated as reducing the net increase in
SPI's unrestricted-earmark funds, which is a change from my
previous report (where they reduced the earmark-TBD funds).

This month I have included an adjustment to the January
profit/loss statement and a correspondingly adjusted balance
sheet. The adjustment of accrued dividends for the AmEx
account will be a commonplace occurrence, given that the
dividends accrue monthly but we receive only quarterly
statements. Suggestions are welcome for ways to avoid the
need to restate each month the preceding month's entire
balance sheet in such cases. This may become moot once we
finish setting up online access for that account.

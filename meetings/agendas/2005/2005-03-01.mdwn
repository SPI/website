ObMeta: I'm not 100% sure who needs to agree this or the form it
should take. -- MJR, a contributing member

Can you add "Implementing the BBB Wise Giving Alliance Standards
for Charity Accountability http://www.give.org/standards/"
to the meeting agenda, please?

Here's the presentation:

The BBB Wise Giving Alliance is a Better Business Bureau which
publishes standards for US non-profit organisations.

Their standards for charity accountability seek to help donors
make "sound" giving decisions and encourage public confidence
in non-profit organisations.

SPI does not meet all the standards now and is not working
towards them, as far as I can tell.  Actions needed include
publishing how to obtain a recent good financial report near
the web site's call for donations, and submitting a short
performance review to the next general meeting.

I ask the board to appoint a standards reviewer to report next
meeting and, now and/or in future, to take actions to meet the
standards as identified.

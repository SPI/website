### Open a New Contractor Position
(From Jonatas)

<pre>
I would like to submit for the next board meeting on September 9th to open a contractor position to aid with administrative tasks, specially those which have no one assigned to and often get stale or stuck impacting SPI performance and efficiency, such as HR, Press (actually, just posting a bit in our abandoned PR), or Agenda.

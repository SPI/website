### Phone System

(From Célestin Matte)

There are several tickets related to phone that have been stuck for a while:
  * [5788](https://rt.spi-inc.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=5788)
  * [6642](https://rt.spi-inc.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=6642)

In short, the open questions are:
  * what is SPI's official number? (Additionally: should domain information be updated to the latest known google voice number?)
  * other numbers are mentioned. What are these (and are they still active)?

On my side, I have no access or visibility on current setup.

I was also asked in January to move phone to a service such as voip.ms, but I never got the details on that ([related meeting logs](https://www.spi-inc.org/meetings/logs/2023/2023-01-09-log.txt)).
What does SPI have now? Is there a number or other services to transfer there?
I started creating an account to move things forward. Can somebody review the ToS? [https://voip.ms/terms-of-service](https://voip.ms/terms-of-service)

## Resolution 2015-11-11.jrk.1: Acknowledging the election of David Graham to the Canadian House of Commons

<pre>
WHEREAS

1. David de Burgh Graham (hereafter "Graham") was formerly a longtime
member of the Software in the Public Interest board of directors,
helping with numerous legal and logistical matters during his time on the
board.

2. Graham has held several other prominent roles in the free and open
source software community over the past 15 years, including serving as a
journalist and founding the Open and Free Technology Community, an
SPI-affiliated project which offers communication services to the free and
open source software movement.

3. Graham has been a user of Linux-based operating systems for 20 years.

4. On October 19, 2015, Graham was elected to the Canadian House of Commons
as the Member of Parliament for Laurentides-Labelle.

5. Knowledge of the free and open source software movement in general and
of Linux-based operating systems specifically is a valuable but scarce
resource among national legislators.

6. Graham has this knowledge coupled with the skill of sharing it with
broader audiences from his time in journalism.

7. National governments make many policy decisions which affect the health
of the free and open source software movement within that country and
worldwide.

8. Being an MP of the political party which now forms the government of
Canada, Graham is well-positioned to provide informed input regarding the
free and open source software movement as such policy decisions are made.

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

1. SPI congratulates Graham on his election to the Canadian House of
Commons as the Member of Parliament for Laurentides-Labelle and wishes
him well in that endeavor.

2. SPI encourages greater sharing of expertise regarding free and open
source software with all elected officials to help in their policy and
technology decisions.

3. SPI shall issue and publicize a press release substantially based on
this resolution, including a suitable quote from one or more current SPI
directors and layman-friendly descriptions of the free and open source
software movement and of SPI.

4. In recognition of Canadian bilingualism and of Graham's
majority-Francophone constituency, the aforementioned press release and
this resolution will be published in both French and English unless
volunteer translation services cannot be obtained with reasonable effort.

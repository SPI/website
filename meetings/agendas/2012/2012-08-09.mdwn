## President's report

We hosted an SPI BOF at DebConf 12 just after last month's meeting, as with
all DebConf sessions, [video](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2012/debconf12/low/847_SPI_BOF.ogv) is available if anyone wants to watch it.

The other real news from me this month is that I'm taking [early retirement from HP](http://www.gag.com/bdale/blog/posts/Early_Retirement.html) at the end of August.


## Treasurer's report

<pre>
This report uses a cash-based method of accounting, recording donations
when deposited (not when the check was written or received by us) and
recording expenses when sent or scheduled for payment (not when
incurred).

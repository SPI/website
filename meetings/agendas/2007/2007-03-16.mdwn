Notes: Balance includes all accumulated funds to date, except for
securities interest income for 2006 which is not yet accounted.  This
report counts donation dates slightly differently from the required IRS
rules and thus will differ slightly from our accounting reports.  Balance
forward from 2005 and earlier is assumed to be 100% Debian funds (see
below).

Accounting Status
------------------
All 2006 donations and expenses are entered into the ad-hoc data entry
system.  After some discussion with our accountant, these amounts will be
imported into the accountant's proprietary system for preparation of our
2006 taxes.  We will start fresh for 2007 with ledgerSMB; the Treasurer
plans to pay a LedgerSMB developer to make this happen a little faster
than it has been.
We have terminated our relationship with Mark's bookkeeping service, and
they have forwarded copies of all of our files.

Tax/IRS Status
-------------------
The IRS requested additional information for our 2005 Form 990, namely a
listing of donors over $5000.  I forwarded this information to them and
have not heard back.  We need to start harassing them again about updating
our address.

We have begun preparation of our 2006 taxes but because 2006 is not
reconciled, we will probably file an extension.

I will have filed our New York registration by the board meeting.

## President's report

<pre>
We had a successful treasury team sprint November 20-21, 2019 in NYC
followed by a productive board meeting November 22-23, 2019, also in
NYC. The treasury team was able to process the vast majority of the
outgoing payment backlog and the board is planning weekly meetings to
help stay on top of ticket backlog (both treasury and general board
tickets).

The board received the final audit report for 2018 from our accounting
firm and posted it on the treasurer section of the website. Our 990
(Federal return) and CHAR500 (New York State return) were also filed by
the deadline. We have reached out to the accounting firm to discuss the
feasibility of starting the 2019 audit earlier in the year.

The SPI board is extremely thankful for the work Martin Michlmayr has
done working with the auditor and streamlining our bookkeeping. SPI has
renewed his contract through the end of 2020.

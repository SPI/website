## Resolution 2019-05-02.jrk.1: Freedesktop.org merger into X.org

<pre>
WHEREAS

1. SPI currently recognizes Freedesktop.org and X.org as SPI associated
projects.

2. Freedesktop.org and X.org decided to merge, with X.org as the
surviving project, due to significant overlap in participants and
purpose.

3. On April 11, 2019, the projects granted their final approval to this
merger according to their internal procedures.

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

1. Freedesktop.org will be removed from the list of SPI associated
projects, because it no longer exists independently of X.org.

2. Assets and (if any) liabilities held by SPI for Freedesktop.org are
now held by SPI on behalf of X.org and shall be accounted as such.

3. SPI shall no longer actively seek donations for Freedesktop.org.
Donations which SPI nevertheless receives for Freedesktop.org shall be
treated as donations for X.org.
</pre>

## Consider proposal to add translatewiki.net as a project

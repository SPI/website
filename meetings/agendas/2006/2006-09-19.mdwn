==============================================

This report uses a cash-based method of accounting,
recording donations when deposited (not when the check was
written or received by us) and recording expenses when sent
or scheduled for payment (not when incurred). Network for
Good processing fees are no longer listed, both to avoid
confusion and since they are already subtracted out from our
check before we ever receive it. Income from our Ameriprise
Financial account (with income from the RVS Cash Management
fund) for the statement period ending January 16 is included
in January's report despite it covering a period of three
months.

[1] This is current as of January 16, the closing date of our most recent
Ameriprise statement, and covers the period from October 14, 2005, through
then.
[2] Again, keep in mind that the lack of donations listed only means we did
not deposit any donations in January, not that we received none. Reread the
first paragraph of this report if this is unclear.

[1] Our records don't make clear what this expense is, although Branden might
possibly remember. Regardless, the only fair thing to do is treat this as SPI
earmark.

[1] Debian does not actually have a negative amount of funds; this number
doesn't include DebConf-earmarked funds or any funds in the Ameriprise
account. Additionally, most of the funds whose earmarks remain to be
determined are Debian's.

[1] This is current as of April 16, the closing date of our most recent
Ameriprise statement, and covers the period from January 17 through then.

[2] I am mainly listing this so that it's clear that the FirstIB and
Ameriprise account values are changing and why, not because it's any net
change in SPI assets; it's not. This was related to DebConf6.

[3] This is to be repaid (at 0% interest) automatically as soon as DebConf
has sufficient funds.

### Discussion appendix

<pre>
Since there's a new board, I thought it might be a reasonable time to
go back over some of the issues that Debian would appreciate SPI input on:

    1) Response to concerns related to the acceptance of Sun Java into
       non-free, see:
           From: John Goerzen &lt;jgoerzen@complete.org&gt;
           Date: Wed, 7 Jun 2006 18:28:22 -0500
           Subject: Questions about Java license and related questions
           Message-ID: &lt;20060607232822.GA31686@katherina.lan.complete.org&gt;

    2) Response to concerns related to interaction between Debian developers
       and citizens of embargoed countries, see:
           From: Anthony Towns &lt;aj@azure.humbug.org.au&gt;
           Date: Fri, 9 Jun 2006 17:47:49 +1000
           Subject: Debian in embargoed countries
           Message-ID: &lt;20060609074749.GB1408@azure.humbug.org.au&gt;

    3) Response to concerns related to online harassment, see:
           From: Steve Langasek &lt;vorlon@debian.org&gt;
           Date: Fri, 9 Jun 2006 17:04:51 -0700
           Subject: request for assistance with ongoing harassment
               [debianwomenpassaway@yahoo.com: Debian women: please pass away.]
           Message-ID: &lt;20060610000450.GN13192@mauritius.dodds.net&gt;

    4) Precise accounting of funds held for the benefit of the Debian
       project (my imprecise estimate is $0, split between -$50,000 for
       debconf, and +$50,000 for misc debian use, which will obviously
       only be useful when the HP money makes its way in)
None
    5) Is there any sort of online/electronic report of donations from
       Click &amp; Pledge that can be made available?

    6) I think Debian would appreciate it if SPI would formally comment
       on the asset handling changes proposed on debian-vote, to ensure we
       can maintain a friendly and consultative relationship. (Even if the
       comment is just "yup, that's fine by us!" or whatever) See the threads
       related to:

### Resolutions

<pre>
Resolution 2006-04-03.jfsp.1: Debian trademark in Spain

WHEREAS

1. The Debian trademark in Spain is currently held by Jesus Martinez which
  has no association with either the Debian project or SPI Inc.

2. The SPI trademark committee wants to register the Debian trademark EU-wide
  and any registration in an EU country will stall the process

3. Mr. Martinez has been contacted by the "Debian Spain" association and
  by Javier de la Cueva and has rejected to transfer the trademark over to
  SPI unless the following terms are met:
      * Deletion of all Internet web pages with prior references to
        Mr.  Martínez trademark appropriation.
      * Payment of 3,000 Euros as a fee for having made the defense of
        the trademark and the costs.
      * SPI letter granting him the rights to use perennially the trademark
        "Debian".

4. The SPI Board considers the transfer term unacceptable.

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

5. SPI will initiate legal actions against Mr. Martinez.

6. SPI will provide a notarized and apostilled Power of Attorney to
  the Spanish lawyer Javier de la Cueva, who will act in a Pro Bono basis,
  and will litigate on behalf of SPI.

7. SPI will provide certificates of the trademark registry and any other
  relevant documents to Javier de la Cueva needed to provide
  documentary evidences necessary to defend the case.

1. WHEREAS the Board of Directors of Software in the Public Interest is
responsible for the operation of the organisation;

2. and WHEREAS the Board of Directors performs its business at its
meetings;

3. and WHEREAS Board members are expected to attend all meetings;

4. and WHEREAS Board members who do not attend a reasonable number of

meetings while they are members as having an attendance status that is one
of:
  a. Absent,
  b. Absent, with regrets,
  c. Present, with exception,
  d. Present;

7. A Board member who fails to attend a valid Board meeting, and who has
not sent the Board regrets for the meeting at least twenty-four (24) hours
prior to the scheduled start of the meeting, shall be marked as: "Absent",
but may, by a vote of the Board at the time the Minutes are being approved
for that meeting be marked as "Absent, with regrets" without notice having
been received should the Board be satisfied that reasonable notice was not
possible;

sent the Board regrets at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the

the year prior to their first appointment to the Board;

### Treasurer's Report

Software in the Public Interest Financial Data
==============================================

This report uses a cash-based method of accounting,
recording donations when deposited (not when the check was
written or received by us) and recording expenses when sent
or scheduled for payment (not when incurred). Network for
Good processing fees are no longer listed, both to avoid
confusion and since they are already subtracted out from our
check before we ever receive it.

[1] Again, keep in mind that the lack of donations listed only means we did
not deposit any donations in December, not that we received none. Reread the
first paragraph of this report if this is unclear. Branden deposited these
donations in February, I've been told.

[2] Branden's BANK: mail about this said $0.64, but the online bank record
says $0.68.

### Discussion appendix

<pre>
-- PostgreSQL Conference arrangements: some of the stuff that we need to do
for the conference requires SPI Board approval (such as insurance).  Need to
discuss and vote.

-- New methods for online donations and payments, per Jimmy.

-- New website for SPI?  I've noticed that SPI seems to have trouble keeping
the web site up to date.  I think that using a community website CMS, such as
Framewerk, Drupal, etc. would help with this enormously.  Depending on the
technology employed, the PostgreSQL project would be happy to install and
host something.

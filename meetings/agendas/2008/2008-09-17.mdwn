    organization around Tux Typing [II] (TuxType); Tux, of Math Command
    (TuxMath) and Tux Paint).

 2. The Tux4Kids developers would like SPI's support and assistance,
    including receiving and holding property (e.g., donations) on behalf
    of the project, dispersing donations to project members, legal
    advice and representation, and possibly other services to be decided
    later by Tux4Kids.

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

 3. Tux4Kids is formally invited to become an SPI Associated Project,

    which can be found at

    precedence.  The decisionmakers will appoint their own successors.

 5. This invitation will lapse, if not accepted, 60 days after it is
    approved by the SPI Board.

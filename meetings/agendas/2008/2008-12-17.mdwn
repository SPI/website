### Secretary's report

<pre>
I am in the process of arranging an online meeting for this upcoming
weekend (Dec 20th or 21st) including SPI site administrator Joerg Jaspert,
website volunteer MJ Ray, and me to discuss plans for moving forward with the
website overhaul. There should be more news on this front in time for the
January secretary's report.
</pre>

### Resolution 2008-12-17.bg.1: Privoxy as associated project

<i>(Secretary's note: The text of this resolution was not distributed
significantly in advance of the meeting, but it has been allowed onto the
agenda since the substance of the resolution was discussed extensively on the
spi-private mailing list well in advance of this meeting, and since the meeting
announcement which was sent out more than 48 hours in advance included a
reference to the possibility of a previously discussed and positively viewed
associated project resolution or two being discussed at the meeting. Given the
lack of advance notice of the exact text, it will not be voted on at this
meeting if any board members present object to doing so.)</i>

<pre>
WHEREAS

 1. Privoxy is a significant Free Software project, delivering a non-caching
    HTTP proxy that is commonly used to increase a user's privacy level,
    to block ads, and to rewrite content for other purposes.

 2. The Privoxy developers would like SPI's support and assistance,
    including receiving and holding property (e.g., donations) on behalf
    of the project, dispersing donations to project members, legal
    advice and representation, holding assets such as the privoxy.org domain,
    and possibly other services to be decided later by the Privoxy developers.

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

 3. Privoxy is formally invited to become an SPI Associated Project,
    according to the SPI Framework for Associated Projects, SPI
    Resolution 1998-11-16.iwj.1-amended-2004-08-10.iwj.1, a copy of
    which can be found at
    https://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/resolutions/2004/2004-08-10.iwj.1

 4. Fabian Keil is recognised by SPI as the current authoritative decision
    maker for Privoxy.  This can be changed in the future by consensus vote
    of Hal Burgiss, Fabian Keil, and David Schmidt.

 5. This invitation will lapse, if not accepted, 60 days after it is
    approved by the SPI Board.
</pre>

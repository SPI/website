### Secretary's report

Michael Schultheiss was re-elected and Jonathan McDowell was newly elected to
the SPI Board of Directors last month. Congratulations to them both. Thanks to
Greg Sabino Mullane for running. Neil McGovern has completed his term on the
Board. Thanks to him for his service, and for running the 2009 SPI Board
elections.

Due to unforeseen logistical delays, OSUNIX will not be able to have a letter
from their lawyer at the Software Freedom Law Center in time for this meeting
which explains the resolution of their licensing issues. Therefore, they have
agreed to delay revisiting their request to become an SPI associated project
until the September board meeting.

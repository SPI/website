### Secretary's report

As a reminder, next year's annual Debian Conference, DebConf10, will be in the
US for the first time (specifically NYC), and so SPI will be serving as the
local legal entity. I am the lead of the DebConf10 local team. In my role as
SPI Secretary, I provided a visa invitation letter to a Debian participant who
wishes to attend and who will need a visa. This letter was drafted in
consultation with me by a lawyer, Frank Bynum, with knowledge of visa,
immigration, and border law who has agreed to help DebConf10 with these
issues.

Substantially the same letter, as modified for each visa applicant's
individual circumstances, is expected to be used for the rest of the DebConf10
visa invitation letters, without further mention in SPI secretary's reports
unless specific circumstances warrant it. I can provide the letter template to
the board and others upon request, but DebConf does not wish to make it public
to reduce the risk of abuse by those wishing to involve DebConf in illegal
immigration attempts. (This happens every year, not just for the US-based
conference.)

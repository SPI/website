### Secretary's report

<pre>
(none)
</pre>


### SPI Resolution 2009-11-04.jmd.1: Contributing membership expiry

<pre>
WHEREAS

1. Article 3 of the corporate by-laws state: "If a contributing
   membership is not renewed, the member's status will be downgraded to
   a non-contributing member.";

2. Voter turnout and quorum is measured as a function of
   contributing membership;

3. There is no existing practical measure of a member's activity;

4. Elections are the most effective means of verifying a member's
   activity and our electoral system does not require a voting member
   to express an opinion on their ballot

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

5. Be it resolved that any contributing member who does not cast a ballot
   in an annual Board member election shall be considered potentially
   inactive. Any contributing member considered potentially inactive shall
   be contacted after the election to confirm their status; if no response
   is received within 4 weeks of this initial contact they shall be deemed
   inactive and downgraded to a non-contributing member. However no such
   downgrading shall preclude any member from restoring their contributing
   membership status at any later date;

6. In the event that no annual Board member election takes place,
   regardless of reason, the membership list will not be affected
   until the next such election takes place;

7. Any contributing membership that exists under any other resolutions
   or clauses that is not subject to expiry will not expire.
</pre>

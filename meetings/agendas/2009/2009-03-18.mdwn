### Secretary's report

* Within 40 minutes of the conclusion of the February 11 board meeting, the
  Board and I received an email from Ken Starks of HeliOS accepting SPI's
  offer of associated project status for HeliOS, thus making it official.
* Also, I finally made the promised typo fix to the May 2008 minutes (removing
  a duplicated occurrence of the word "announced").
* Lastly, the information in Appendix A has been changed slightly, showing the
  date of last election to the board instead of the date of first election, and
  reducing the granularity of the displayed date to the month level. This is
  more useful for planning future election cycles and had been requested for
  some time by David Graham. Thanks to him for the idea.


### Resolution 2009-03-18.mcs.1: Update Ameriprise's owner list

_(Secretary's note: The resolution was submitted without a title. I have
supplied one based on the introductory text in Michael's email.)_

<pre>
WHEREAS

 1. Ameriprise Financial ("Ameriprise") currently holds funds in an
    account for Software in the Public Interest, Inc. ("SPI");

 2. Ameriprise's list of account owners for SPI's account is out of
    date, listing only Branden Robinson (a former SPI board member) and
    James R. Kaplowitz;

 3. Ameriprise requires a Board resolution or meeting minutes
    enumerating those who should be listed as account owners for a
    corporation;

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

 3. The account owners for SPI's Ameriprise account should be updated to
    include Michael C. Schultheiss, remove Branden Robinson, and retain
    James R. Kaplowitz;

 4. This resolution supersedes resolution 2006-04-18.br.1                       </pre>

### Resolution 2009-03-16.jrk.1.iwj.1: OpenWRT as associated project

<pre>
WHEREAS

 1. OpenWRT is a substantial and useful open source project.

 2. OpenWRT would like SPI's support and assistance, including taking
    donations.

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

 3. OpenWRT is formally invited to become an SPI
    Associated Project, according to the SPI Framework for Associated
    Projects, SPI Resolution 1998-11-16.iwj.1-amended-2004-08-10.iwj.1, a
    copy of which can be found at
    http://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/resolutions/2004-08-10.iwj.1

 4. SPI recognises that OpenWRT is governed by the Charter available at
    https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/NonProfit, as modified from time to time
    via the processes in the Charter itself.

 5. SPI understands that Andy Boyett and Gregers Petersen have been
    appointed according to the Charter by OpenWRT as liaisons to SPI.

 6. This invitation will lapse 60 days after it is approved by the SPI Board
    unless each liaison, within that time, has accepted it on behalf of
    OpenWRT, agreed with the other liaison on a single willing third person
    who will be asked to resolve disagreeing instructions from the two
    liaisons, and communicated that choice to the Board.

 7. The third person referred to in paragraph 6 may be replaced under the
    same procedure as any other decision belonging to OpenWRT.

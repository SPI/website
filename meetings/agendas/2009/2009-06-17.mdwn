### Secretary's report

The Open64 project has asked for association with SPI. In order to allow time
for the contributing membership to be consulted via spi-private and a proper
resolution to be drafted, I have not added it to the agenda for the June
meeting. It is likely to be on the agenda for the July meeting.

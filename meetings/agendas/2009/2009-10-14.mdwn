### SPI Resolution 2009-10-1.jj.1: Holding debian.org.tw Domain in trust


<pre>
WHEREAS

1. debian.org.tw (DOT) is an OpenSource, especially Debian, related user
   group in Taiwan. There had been tensions regarding their domain, so
   SPI offers to step in as a neutral outsider.

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

2. SPI Inc. offers to hold the debian.org.tw Domain in trust, pointing
   the NS entries to machines selected by the DOT community. SPI
   Inc. will support a transfer of said domain to a registered non-profit
   organization in Taiwan anytime DOT unanimously asks us to do so

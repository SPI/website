### Secretary's report

I notified Gregers Petersen and the openwrt-hackers email list of SPI's
invitation to become an SPI associated project with Gregers as sole liaison,
and mentioned the 60-day deadline of May 17, 2009. I checked with them on
April 14th, and Gregers replied on the 15th accepting the offer with himself
serving "as main liaison, and Andy Boyett as second/back-up liaison." Unless
the Board deems the existence of a second/back-up liaison to be at odds with
the resolution passed in March, this makes OpenWRT's associated project status
official.

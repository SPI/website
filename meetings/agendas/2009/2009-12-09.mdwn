## Secretary's report

Jonathan McDowell has now taken over completely from Martin Zobel-Helas
as secretary. Martin is thanked for his work in this role and wished all
the best with his forthcoming baby.

Resolutions for YafaRay and sidux as associated projects were posted to
spi-general at the end of November. They've both been outstanding for a
while and little feedback has been received from the membership, so both
are assumed to be uncontentious.


### Resolution 2009-11-27.jmd.1: YafaRay as associated project _(proposed)_

<pre>
WHEREAS

 1. YafaRay is a substantial and useful open source project.

 2. YafaRay would like SPI's support and assistance, including taking
donations.

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

 3. YafaRay is formally invited to become an SPI
Associated Project, according to the SPI Framework for Associated
Projects, SPI Resolution 1998-11-16.iwj.1-amended-2004-08-10.iwj.1, a
copy of which can be found at
https://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/resolutions/2004-08-10.iwj.1

 4. Currently, Alvaro Luna Bautista is recognised by SPI as the current
authoritative decision maker and SPI liaison for YafaRay. Successors
will be appointed by the YafaRay Team, as listed on
http://www.yafaray.org/about

 5. This invitation will lapse, if not accepted, 60 days after it is
approved by the SPI Board.
</pre>


### Resolution 2009-11-27.jmd.2: sidux as associated project _(proposed)_

<pre>
WHEREAS

 1. sidux is a substantial and useful open source project.

 2. sidux would like SPI's support and assistance, including taking
donations.

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

 3. sidux is formally invited to become an SPI
Associated Project, according to the SPI Framework for Associated
Projects, SPI Resolution 1998-11-16.iwj.1-amended-2004-08-10.iwj.1, a
copy of which can be found at
https://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/resolutions/2004-08-10.iwj.1

 4. Currently, Ferdinand Thommes is recognised by SPI as the current
authoritative decision maker and SPI liaison for sidux. In the event
of the liaison becoming unavailable the treasurer of sidux e.V.
(currently Walter Güldenberg) will act as temporary liaison and notify
SPI of any replacement liaison.

 5. This invitation will lapse, if not accepted, 60 days after it is
approved by the SPI Board.

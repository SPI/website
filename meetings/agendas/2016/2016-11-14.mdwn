## President's report

I would like to thank Martin Zobel-Helas and Dimitri John Ledkov for their
outstanding work on getting SPI's financial data into ledger.  I'm happy to
see reports using the new system in the agenda.  I'd also like to thank
Andrew Tridgell for work on PayPal and of course Michael Schultheiss for
his continued work as as SPI Treasurer.

Speaking of ledger, I attended a ledger hackathon this weekend.  John
Wiegley, the maintainer of ledger, looked at [an issue SPI
found](http://bugs.ledger-cli.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1194) but hasn't been
able to resolve it yet.

SFLC confirmed that they can host our face-to-face meeting in February.
I'm looking forward to a productive meeting!

I confirmed that SPI is eligible to join NPCC.  I suggest we join NPCC
and obtain a D&O liability insurance quote through their provider.

Finally, I'm very happy to see a new draft for the by-laws.  Thanks to
Jimmy Kaplowitz.

--------------------------------

Since no report was filed this agenda item was postponed.


5. Branden's reappointment
--------------------------

Resolution 2004-01-06.jrk.1.br.1 replaced Branden Robinson with Jimmy
Kaplowitz as treasurer but did not explicitly remove Branden from the board
of directors. Ean declared that as president he was willing to accept legal
responsibility for allowing Branden on the board until elections can be held
for his position. David proposed resolution 2004-03-02.db1.1 to appoint
Branden to the board of directors as an interim member until the next
annual meeting. Ian seconded the motion and Ean called for a vote:

  Branden: abstains
  Bruce  : in favour
  David  : in favour
  Ean    : in favour
  Ian    : in favour
  Jimmy  : in favour
  Joey   : abstains
  John   : in favour
  Mako   : in favour

The resolution is accepted with seven votes in favour and none against.


6. Suspension of by-laws vote
-----------------------------

Since SPI's legal council noticed some possible problems with the proposed
new by-laws Branden proposed resolution 2004.03.02.meeting.1 to suspend
the active by-laws vote until legal counsel has fully reviewed the
proposals. Ean called for a vote:

  Branden: in favour
  Bruce  : in favour
  David  : in favour
  Ean    : in favour
  Ian    : in favour
  Jimmy  : in favour
  Joey   : in favour
  John   : abstains
  Mako   : in favour

The resolution is accepted with eight votes in favour and none against. Ean
asked who will take the lead in working with Chris Rourk to review and
reintroduce the by-laws changes. David promised the by-laws committee
would take care of this.


7. wxWidgets
------------

Ian proposed resolution 2004-03-02.iwj.1 to adopt the wxWidgets project.
Mako asked if anyone would volunteer as a contact person for wxWidgets
until they knew their way around SPI and added he would be happy to do
this himself. Ean called for a vote:

  Branden: in favour
  Bruce  : in favour
  David  : in favour
  Ean    : in favour
  Ian    : in favour
  Jimmy  : in favour
  Joey   : in favour
  John   : abstains
  Mako   : in favour

The resolution is accepted with eight votes in favour and none against.

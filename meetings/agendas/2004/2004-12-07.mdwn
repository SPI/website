### OpenC++ as associated project

<pre>
Hello,

My name is Grzegorz Jakacki, I am a team leader of OpenC++ software project
(opencxx.sourceforge.net). OpenC++ is a mature open-source C++ program
transformation framework, distributed under non-copyleft open-source
license.

I am writing to solicit information about possibility of winning
support of Software in Public Interest for OpenC++.

Recently I worked together with Stefan Seefeld who is a project leader of
Synopsis, a project hosted at SPI. Synopsis is in part based on OpenC++, and
recently Stefan and myself came to conclusion that the common part of those two
could and should be factored out and extended into reusable library, nicknamed
OpenC++ Core.

As Synopsis is hosted at SPI it would help if OpenC++ Core could be hosted here
too. Thus my question is how should OpenC++ Core project apply for hosting at
SPI, what information should it provide to support application, and what is an
expected timeframe for SPI to decide on this matter.

Thank you
Grzegorz

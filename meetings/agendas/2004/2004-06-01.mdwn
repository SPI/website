3. Approving minutes: March 2nd, May 4th
----------------------------------------

Bruce moved to accept the minutes for the March 2nd May 4th board
meetings as submitted by the secretary. Ean called for a vote:

  Branden : in favour
  Bruce   : in favour
  David   : in favour
  Ean     : in favour
  Ian     : in favour
  Jimmy   : in favour
  Joey    : abstains
  John    : in favour

  Wichert : in favour

The minutes were accepted with nine votes in favour, none against and
one abstention.


4. Resolution 2004-06-01.dbg.1: Current Board Membership
--------------------------------------------------------

Ean asked if anyone had comments on this resolution. Nobody had comments
so Ean called for a vote:

  Branden : in favour
  Bruce   : in favour
  David   : in favour
  Ean     : in favour
  Ian     : in favour
  Jimmy   : in favour
  Joey    : in favour
  John    : in favour
  Mako    : in favour
  Wichert : in favour

The resolution is accepted unanimously.

Branded suggested using this resolution to remind Drew Streib about his
board membership and the board should invite him to resign if he can not
fulfil his commitment. Wichert said he already intended to talk to Drew
since he has not attended three meetings in a row and thus already
failed the attendance policy.


5. Annual general members meeting
---------------------------------

David withdrew 2004-05-28.dbg.2 in favour of 2004-05-28.dbg.2.iwj.1.
Branden, Jimmy, Mako and Wichert second 2004-05-28.dbg.2.iwj.1 and a
vote is called for:

  Branden : in favour
  Bruce   : in favour
  David   : in favour
  Ean     : in favour
  Ian     : in favour
  Jimmy   : in favour
  Joey    : in favour
  John    : in favour
  Mako    : in favour
  Wichert : in favour

The resolution is accepted unanimously.


6. Resolution 2004-05-28.dbg.1: Expedited Meeting Minutes
---------------------------------------------------------

Ian had noticed an inconsistency: in one place logs were considered to be
minutes while in another place they were only a stand in. Joey also
noticed that irc logs were not marked as interim minutes. Ian proposed
an amendment to fix these two errors, which was accepted and a vote
was called for the new resolution 2004-05-28.dbg.1.iwj.1:

  Branden : in favour
  Bruce   : in favour
  David   : in favour
  Ean     : in favour
  Ian     : in favour
  Jimmy   : in favour
  Joey    : against
  John    : in favour
  Mako    : in favour
  Wichert : in favour

The resolution was accepted with nine votes in favour and one against.


7. Date for next meeting
------------------------

David asked if the question of board member election would be addressed
at the meeting.  Ean thought it would require more discussion and he did
not want to drop it on everyone right before the meeting. Jimmy
suggested that it be dealt with via email or at the next board meeting,
to which David agreed but added he would like to resolve it by email so
it would be resolved before the July meeting. Wichert said that anyone
could suggest this as an agenda item in which case it would have to be
addressed.

As the by-laws dictate the annual general members meeting (AGM) will be on
July 1st. Mako noticed that that conflicts with USENIX where he would be
giving a talk at that date. David added it also conflicts with Canada
day. Wichert noted that the date is set by the by-laws and can not be
changed.

Ean suggested combining the AGM and the regular next board meeting. Ian
suggested having the regular meeting thirty minutes before the AGM so
the board could prepare. Wichert proposed having the board meeting
at the standard time of 19:00 UTC and the AGM at 20:00 UTC. After some
discussion this proposal was accepted.

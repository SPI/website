## Items up for Discussion

### Interim Replacement Secretary

Interim replacement of secretary, from Forrest Fleming to Zach van Rijn, according to discussions held in board mailing list, no change to board membership.

### Proposal for Communication Committee

Proposal from membership for a communication committee, to provide the secretary a relief from communication duties, specially [sic] when already overwhelmed with other secretary duties.

### Decide How to Handle 2019 By-Laws Revision

Considering the needs which led to 2019 By Laws change proposals have remained and been aggravated by the pandemics — made more evident by upcoming election of a single chair, and the previous vote failed due to being inquorate, which is typically attributed to the complexity of changes and inactive members, considering that we already revised expiry changes, Jonatas L. Nogueira would like the board to declare if it pretends [sic] to resubmit the draft for review, make a last round of membership feedback, or start over. Not taking any action is also on the table.

The 2019 draft and FAQ is at [https://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/votes/2019-bylaws-revision/](https://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/votes/2019-bylaws-revision/).

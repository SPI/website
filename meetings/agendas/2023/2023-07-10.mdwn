### Decide Whether Counsel Needs to Review Clause Change

From Jonatas: Tickets 6224 and 6571 changed a single clause in the default contracts,
and need a decision whenever these changes need to be relayed to legal counsel or not
(the changes are not major). Reply from officers regarding reviewing contracts has
been slower than usual, but contracts are still being reviewed and signed (although
with degraded performance). In order to avoid these contracts from dragging out for
longer than necessary and to avoid overburdening the officers, it is requested of the
board (bylaws article 7 paragraph 3) to appreciate the matter.

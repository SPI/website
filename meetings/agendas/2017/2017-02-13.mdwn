## President's report

<pre>
I'm happy to see that Jimmy Kaplowitz has sent out a third draft of the
proposed new by-laws to spi-general for review and that feedback has
been positive.  We should open a vote on this soon.

I've started working on the 2016 annual report and have received a
number of updates from associated projects.  If you have any content,
please let me know.

I'm looking forward to a productive face-to-face meeting in New York
next week!

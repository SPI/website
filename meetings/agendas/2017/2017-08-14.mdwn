## President's report

<pre>
I had the pleasure of attending Debian Conference (DebConf17) in
Montreal last week.  We held a BoF (birds of a feather) session on SPI
and it was good to meet several SPI directors and members.  We've also
agreed on a date for a face-to-face meeting in October.  There's a lot
to discuss and I'm looking forward to a productive meeting.

I'd like to thank Luca Filipozzi for his work on formalizing what the
reimbursement process for DebConf17 should be like and for driving on
getting all the parts together to make reimbursements go smoothly.

I'd also like to thank Martin Zobel-Helas and Michael Schultheiss for
their continued work on improving our bookkeeping process.  I look
forward to the publication of regular treasurer reports in the near
future.

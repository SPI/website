The SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

1. The Board hereby proposes to the SPI contributing members, for their
approval in accordance with paragraphs 3 through 5 of this resolution,
that the SPI by-laws be amended and restated by replacing their text in
its entirety by the contents of this document, with the necessary
changes to the header and footer to reflect its final approval:
http://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/votes/2018-bylaws-revision/spi-2018-proposed-bylaws.pdf
(SHA256 checksum
6c77d22ea63d8b44920aa645d1151197da9718c3e39bccbd9586a7988382615f).

2. The Board asks SPI members to consult
http://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/votes/2018-bylaws-revision/2018-bylaws-revision-faq/
for answers to common questions about this proposed change.

3. The Secretary shall, directly or through one or more delegates,
conduct a vote of the contributing membership on the amendment and
restatement of SPI's by-laws in paragraph 1. The voting reference
materials shall include the document referenced in paragraph 2. In
accordance with the first paragraph of Article Twelve of the current
by-laws, the affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the members
shall be required for approval. The amendment and restatement shall
become effective immediately if and when approved.

4. If an annual election to the board of directors occurs in 2018, the
vote described in paragraph 3 shall happen as soon as logistically
feasible (within the reasonable discretion of the Secretary) following
the completion of contributing membership expiry procedures as described
in paragraph 1 of Resolution 2009-11-04.jmd.1, but in any case not
between November 17, 2018 and January 4, 2019.

5. If an annual election to the board of directors does not occur in
2018, whether due to insufficient candidates or for any other reason,
the vote described in paragraph 3 shall happen as soon as logistically
feasible (within the reasonable discretion of the Secretary) after this
fact is determined, but in any case not between November 17, 2018 and
January 4, 2019.

6. Subject to paragraphs 7 and 8, the Board hereby approves the contents of
http://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/votes/2018-bylaws-revision/2018-proposed-membership-guidelines/
as of the date of the approval of this resolution (git commit
ca29634fad9addb866c5541f436bf8fbef27b005 in SPI's website repository) as
the initial contents of the membership guidelines document referred to
by the amended and restated by-laws.

7. The approval in paragraph 6 will be of no effect if the vote referred
to in paragraph 3 fails to approve the amendment and restatement of the
bylaws.

8. The Board reserves the right to further revise the initial contents
of the membership guideline document by a subsequent resolution before
the beginning of the vote described in paragraph 3, but does not
currently anticipate making such a revision. If any provision in such a
further revision reduces the rights or increases the responsibilities of
the members, such provision will not take effect until at least 30 days
after the members are informed of the Board's approval.

## President's report

<pre>
I'm very happy to see the great progress with reimbursements and
treasurer reports.  As far as I can tell, there's not a single
reimbursement outstanding where we're not waiting for information!
Thanks to Martin Zobel-Helas and Michael Schultheiss for making this
happen.  I'd also like to thank everyone who work on the treasurer
report, in particular Martin but also Michael and Tim Potter, who
helped with the PayPal import script.

I'm also happy to see that Joerg Jaspert continues to help on the IT
side after stepping down from the board.  Jimmy Kaplowitz continues to
work on the new by-laws and we're currently waiting on SFLC.

Personally, I spent time interacting with existing and potential
projects, worked on the annual report, and performed some triage work on
RT.  I was able to acquire the "SPI" organization on GitHub but we have
to discuss whether we want to use it actively.

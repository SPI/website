## President's report

<pre>
Thanks for choosing last month to give me a chance as SPI President. I'll try
to learn from the great examples set by Martin Michlmayr and Bdale Garbee and
will do my best to meet SPI's needs.

My SPI work this month has involved signing several routine letters and
agreements for Debian and X.org, coordinating logistics for the upcoming SPI
face-to-face meeting, and discussing systemd and ProteanOS as possible
associated projects with the various stakeholders inside and outside SPI. We
are deferring the ProteanOS candidacy for further discussion, but systemd
remains an agenda item today.

I greatly appreciate the help provided by many directors on several of these
tasks, especially Martin Michlmayr and Luca Filipozzi.

All of us on the board also want to acknowledge and thank Valerie Young for her
time as SPI director, which ends after today according to her resignation
email, and for her past service as Secretary.

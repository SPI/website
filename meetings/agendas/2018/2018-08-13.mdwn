## Resolution 2018-07-09.mm.1: Removal of MadWifi as an associated project

<pre>
WHEREAS

1. MadWifi became an associated project of SPI in 2008.

2. The goal of the MadWifi project was to coordinate development of
   the Atheros drivers for Linux.

3. The MadWifi driver has been obsoleted by ath5k and ath9k, which are
   both part of the Linux kernel now.  Development of these drivers is
   taken care of by the Linux kernel programmers.

4. The MadWifi project is no longer active.

5. Donations to the MadWifi project were made to improve Atheros and
   wireless support for Linux.

5. The MadWifi project has voted to transfer its assets held by SPI
   to the OpenWrt project.  OpenWrt performs significant work on
   improving wireless support for Linux.

6. While the MadWifi project is no longer active, they would like to
   preserve the domain name and web site for historical purposes.

7. The OpenWrt project has agreed to take on stewardship of the assets
   previously intended for MadWifi.  The OpenWrt project has confirmed
   that it intends to preserve the MadWifi domain name(s) and
   website(s) as long as they are deemed relevant.

THE SPI BOARD RESOLVES THAT

1. MadWifi will be removed as an SPI Associated Project.

2. SPI will no longer actively seek donations on behalf of MadWifi.

3. All assets, including (without limitation) money, domain names, and
   any future donations, held by SPI on behalf of MadWifi, will
   henceforth be held on behalf of OpenWrt.

4. This is subject to any undischarged obligations MadWifi may have.
   We are not aware of any such undischarged obligations.  We ask
   anyone who is aware of any to notify us within 30 days of this
   resolution.

Minutes for the face-to-face board meeting have been started but could
not be completed in time to give enough notice for board review before
the meeting.

Due to personal commitments the bylaw vote was unable to be scheduled
in time to avoid the holiday period and instead will be planned for
January. The time between now and then will be used to figure out (and
document) how to operate the voting infrastructure. tpot, jimmy and
noodles(?) to collaborate on this.

Secretary's TODO list for the next meeting:

* Complete minutes for face-to-face board meeting for December IRC
  meeting.

* Update resolutions votes on during face-to-face board meeting.

  * Vote to replace systemd resolution with intended one
  * Resolution 2018-10-05.mcs.1
  * Vote on authority to open and operate HSBC bank accounts

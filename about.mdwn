SPI is a non-profit organization which was founded to help organizations
develop and distribute open hardware and software. We encourage programmers
to use the
[GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html)
or other licenses that allow free 
redistribution and use of software, and hardware developers to distribute
documentation that will allow device drivers to be written for their product.

SPI acts as a fiscal sponsor to many free and open source projects.

SPI has hosted Wikimedia board elections and audited the tally as a neutral third party since 2007.

### Incorporation

SPI was incorporated as a non-profit organization on June 16, 1997 in the
state of New York. Since then, it has become an umbrella organization for
[projects](/projects/) from the community.

In 1999, the [Internal Revenue Service](http://www.irs.gov/)

of the Internal Revenue Code SPI qualifies for 501 (c) (3) (non-profit
organization) status under section 509 (a) (1) and 170 (b) (1) (A) (vi). This
means that all donations made to SPI and its supported projects are tax
deductible for donors in the United States.

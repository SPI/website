develop and distribute open hardware and software. We encourage programmers
to use the

SPI was incorporated as a non-profit organization on June 16, 1997 in the
state of New York. Since then, it has become an umbrella organization for

In 1999, the [Internal Revenue Service](http://www.irs.gov/)

of the Internal Revenue Code SPI qualifies for 501 (c) (3) (non-profit
organization) status under section 509 (a) (1) and 170 (b) (1) (A) (vi). This

SPI is a non-profit organization which was founded to help organizations
develop and distribute open hardware and software. We encourage programmers
to use the
[GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html)
or other licenses that allow free 
redistribution and use of software, and hardware developers to distribute
documentation that will allow device drivers to be written for their product.

SPI acts as a fiscal sponsor to many free and open source [projects](/projects/).  FOSS projects interested in becoming 
associated to SPI should read the [Associated Project HOWTO](../projects/associated-project-howto/).  Services offered 
to projects can be found [here](../projects/services/).  The relationship between SPI and associated projects is 
explained [here](../projects/relationship/).

SPI has hosted [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org) board
elections and audited the tally as a neutral third party since 2007.

### Incorporation

SPI was incorporated as a non-profit organization on June 16, 1997 in the
state of New York.

In 1999, the [Internal Revenue Service](http://www.irs.gov/)
of the United States government determined that under section 501 (a)
of the Internal Revenue Code SPI qualifies for 501 (c) (3) (non-profit
organization) status under section 509 (a) (1) and 170 (b) (1) (A) (vi). This
means that all donations made to SPI and its supported projects are tax
deductible for donors in the United States.

### How is SPI run?

The documents that define the purpose and operation of SPI are the
By-Laws and the Certificate of Incorporation. It has a
[Board of Directors](/corporate/board/) which includes four

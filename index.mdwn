# Welcome to SPI!

SPI is a non-profit organization which was founded to help organizations 
develop and distribute open hardware and software.  We encourage programmers 
to use any license that allows for the free modification, redistribution and 
use of software, and hardware developers to distribute documentation that 
will allow device drivers to be written for their product.
